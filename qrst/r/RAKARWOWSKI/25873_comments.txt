Time to move West with the rest of the population. Humboldt Park welcomes all new comers and their businesses that they own. Time to buy in Humboldt Park and invest here before the area is hit with these insane tax increases!

Some people thought a couple of criminals made off with items belonging to the garden and it had to deal with the loss. The fact is, the lots were sold to the developer building the two buildings on the two lots South of the garden. It appears that two more building will go up soon. The garden has moved to 3225 W Cortez and will start again to help clean up the neighborhood and make it a great place to raise a family. If you want to learn more about the garden and criminals in the neighborhood, please attend The United Blocks of Humboldt Park meeting on April 7th at 7 P.M. at Association House located at 1116 n Kedzie Ave.

The news and politicians support anti-police lives matter groups and so does a lot of loud mouth people, and now everyone wonders why Chicago is become murder city? Don't charge police with murder when they shoot a drug crazed criminal avoiding arrest with a knife. Maybe this surge in death would not be happening. CCW now rules the day so sad to say.

Al has a Facebook page but he has already removed the gang pictures. He does not own property, his Polish girlfriend does. I just saw a listing for a single family home on the 1800 N block of Talman asking for around 800K, Al will be moving soon enough so write that on a wall of The Bloomingdale Trail. He is a banger, NOT RETIRED, he said so himself above. He will have the same fate of all the other bangers of HP, death (a meaningless one), jail or move away. As pointed out above, crime is way down in HP from Al's bad out days and even with this crime wave, it is NOWHERE near what it use to be. It never will with every million dollar house built in HP. Most of these shooting happened in WEST Humboldt Park, West of Central Park and little to no shootings in the park itself! So I say, BYE-BYE bangers, so glad to see you go!

Msk, Why can't you understand what you read? United Blocks dropped West in it's name because of the large group that took that name and that area as their area of responsibility and are now calling it their neighborhood. United Blocks did not tell them to take that name to separate unwanted people! They made that name for themselves to better that area and have done a great job! Drive west on Chicago Ave from Kedzie and see all the work they have accomplished and their banners along the rebuilt street. So stop spreading your agenda to make it look like I am behind what huge neighborhood groups have done with no assistance from me! If you are all for change like you write, then embrace the new neighborhood association there, and give them the thanks for all the work they have accomplished cleaning up their neighborhood. I will continue to work with my neighbors in our neighborhood to do the same.

Let me add the Democrats that vote for these same corrupt Democrats because all Republicans are evil. Time for voters to wake up and vote for what is best for Chicago and not only for what is best for Democrats only.

BB, you call me names because you have no facts to make your case. You continue to try to label me and go off topic. Do you read EB news and posts? They report crimes and neighbors communicate to each other and work together to make their neighborhood safe. Reporting anything happening in a certain neighborhood, gives the people power over what is going on where they live. Yes, lost dog, I need a plumber, but those posts are only a fraction to crime reports. Just because I am old and I drink Fat Tire when I can does not mean I still can't help my neighbors continue to clean up our neighborhood. You and Al are better than me on one thing, I can not tell the race of someone by reading their posts or title given. The two of you seem to have that one in the bag. Only the two of you are associating "good" with white, and "bad" with minority" and hateful things toward yuppies "whites". I don't know or care what color EBer's are, only that we are working together toward the same goal, a peaceful neighborhood and a great place to raise a family.

People working to clean up their neighborhood on EB, they must be 80 - 90% white. Your words not mine. " Everyblock is another tool for white folks in the city."????? The only people that want their neighborhood to be over run by bangers and violence is Al and his couple of supporters here on EB! The rest must be white? Are you saying only "white folks" support law and order on EB? Do we not read the banger point of view on EB? Maybe you would have more criminals on EB if they did not continue to get removed for threatening law abiding citizens with violence and death. You know, remove yuppies "white folk" in body bags and burn their homes. I think a lot of people of color would disagree with you here on EB.

"Police are not the ones doing the shootings that have occurred recently around George and Albany", okay I will bite, what does that mean? Where do police do shootings? Watch the new today, 83% jump in shootings in Chicago! A huge drop in street stops by police since the CPD Officer was charged with murder after shooting a criminal armed with a knife, using the weapon to stop from being arrested! Your right, this has nothing with the crime that is affecting you here. I just can't put two and two together. I think I am wasting my time here, good luck solving your problem.

You keep saying it is my agenda. You make it seem like I alone want to change the borders. Please slowly read what I have written, The West Humboldt Park group, organized and claimed that area, not me. I can live with the couple of you here that disagree with community groups that have gathered together to clearly define their neighborhoods to better work on clean them up. Trying to exclude neighbors to the West or anywhere for that matter can not be farther from the truth. In fact, it is neighbors working together, taking responsibility for their close knit communities and making them a great place to raise a family again. That is the entire point of a well defined border where their work is being consecrated on. You are right on one thing, I do not have the power to redraw neighborhood lines, but my neighbors and I do. Most Chicagoans agree that it is the neighbors of any neighborhood who decide the borders. Not just you and the couple of others that agree with you here. I suggest you attend several different community meetings like I have and start working with them instead of against people attempting to better their neighborhoods.

The baby boom occurred because prosperity not the availability of section 8 housing! People were fruitful and multiplied because they could afford too. Years ago, I had talked to a teenager holding her baby in Cabrini, telling me how proud she was that her child was the 5th generation living in Cabrini and never wanted to leave. She then introduced me to her Mother, Grand Mother and Great Grand Mother all approximately 12 years of age apart. What lesson can be learned from that encounter, I leave to the readers here to decide. Do you think they chose welfare over not having a child for the pay check that came with it? I have three children and my wife and I did without for years to support them and never needed welfare. I had family, and they supported me and my family and that made us what we are today.

I did not rename the area, The West Humboldt Park Community group did. The area, my neighbors and I worked hard on to clean up is not by any means small. You can say the whole city is our community but my neighbors and I can not make it all safe! City maps are useless, go by what the people who live in that area say. Humboldt Park used to be a sewer and it is now becoming a great place to raise a family again and enjoy the park. All crime has been extremely lowered in HP because of everyone's work here, yet with a bold print headline naming the park as where the violence wrongly occurred sets us back ten years and continues the lie that the park is a dangerous place. I will continue my work to stop the news from portraying the park in such a poor light by reporting crimes that occurred miles away as happening in the park!

Are you confused enough now? Most of my Humboldt Park neighbors place the park in the center of Humboldt Park and the borders approximately four blocks away from every border of the park except to the north because of The Bloomingdale Trail. So, on the East, Western Ave.- on the North Bloomingdale Ave.,- on the West, Central Park and Grand Ave.,-on the South, Chicago Ave.. This places Humboldt Park (the park) in the center of Humboldt Park (the area) to railroad tracks which have always been barrier to neighborhoods. This makes the most sense to all my neighbors I have talked to. The people who disagree with this are people who don't live in Humboldt Park so I take their criticism lightly.

Nice to see you know The West Humboldt Park Development Council. They are doing wonders and should be congratulated for their efforts. I am glad to be of help. The block club West of HP was called The United Blocks of West Humboldt Park until the confusion of the new groups name of The West Humboldt Park Development Council. So a vote was made by it's members to change the block clubs name to The United Blocks of Humboldt Park so not to be considered members of the other group. Also, we are proud of our neighborhood around the park and calling the East side, West Bucktown or West Wicker Park does not do us justice. Humboldt Park is beautiful again, and we all should be proud we live here and not ashamed to say so, even as news faultlessly reports crimes as occurring in the park when they happen miles away.

ElizP, if you travel West on Chicago from Kedzie, you will notice a lot of street and business improvements, also banners stating the area as West Humboldt Park. A new neighborhood/business association was started over there a few years ago calling themselves West HP association. They have taken charge of the area South of Grand and have made great strides in the neighborhood. Hopefully this will clear any confusion and how crimes can be more accurately reported as to the location where they happen instead of making it seem they all happen in the middle of the park.

The city map clearly shows that half of Humboldt Park 'East of Sacramento", is not even in Humboldt Park so I think it takes a little mind to follow it. It also shows that Humboldt Park goes as far West as Cicero and South as far as Kinzie. Kinzie and Cicero in Humboldt Park, you got to be soft to think that. Why don't some people understand times and boarders change, move forward and stop living in the past. A neighborhood is defined by the people who live in it and not property values. Change with the times, Humboldt Park is not the gang ridden hell hole it was just a few year ago, stop telling everyone that it still is to keep law abiding people away.

Al, they still hang out between the flags (see other thread on shooting in front of Alderman's office), but that will soon end also. Was it not you who called HP a "Yuppie Paradise"? I will agree with you that HP will NEVER completely gentrify but that is what makes HP better than Wicker Park and Buck Town. The criminals are moving out because they do not own and the law abiding property owners are enjoying the benefits of their hard work. DIVERSITY makes HP beautiful and not just one group ruling over the park. All of us that invested into HP when everyone else said it was a gang banging hell hole can now rejoice as your time is ending. HP now attracts investors and new businesses and no bangers are going to stop it. A property on your block was listed for over 700K and now is off the market, I can only assume it was sold in less that a month. Do you think bangers will now pay the garbage can tax along with the higher rents? I don't see it happening, only them moving out.

From what I saw on the DNA map was that MOST say Humboldt Park ends at Central Park, placing this shooting in an area now known as West Humboldt Park. West HP has it's own associations that chose that name and are working on cleaning up that neighborhood. If the press would use the proper areas name, reports of violent crime occurring in Humboldt Park would drop by 90%!

I have raised my family here at Division and Kedzie and it has been a long road but it is so much better than it was when we first moved in over a decade ago, there is no way to describe it. In June there is an event and gangs from miles away come and drive around the park, that weekend is horrible. After that, the gangs pretty much vanish and the true beauty of Humboldt Park can be enjoyed in peace. Thomas is a nice block but is located in the 011th CPD District which is very busy South of Grand Ave..I believe HP is again a great place to raise a family and will only get better with you and all the other new people moving in every day. Welcome, it would be great to be your neighbor.

" reducing the description to a single, unhelpful word isn't helpful, just stupid.", let me add dangerous because these violent offenders could be walking up to you right now, about to attack! You can not protect yourself from criminals unless you know what they look like. Why don't you post the description of these violent offenders from what is given in the DNA story here on this thread and we will see if it is removed by EB for being to exact?

Tenants frequently use the security deposit as a way to get two months rent back after having been evicted for not paying their rent and get it in housing court.

— On the neighbor message 606 Trail
8:28 a.m.
@TT, I will have to agree with others here that you just don't get it. A security deposit was used to discourage a tenant from leaving a apartment in worse of a condition then when they moved in. The tenant would get their money back if no cost in repairing the unit was passed on to the owner. Now that same security deposit is use to screw the Landlord if the tenant gets a hair up their rear end. Politicians thought this one up so tenants can screw their Landlord for any BS reason, thus anti-owner. I give my tenants a choice between the two and most tenants choose the move in fee so why is this so mind boggling to only you? I don't care what you do with your tenants so why do you call the rest of us greedy with how we deal with ours? Again, I think that after getting ordered into housing court a few times, you will think differently, and from what you wrote about what you do, it will happen very soon.

— On the neighbor message Apartment 4 Rent

@TT, that is not what you wrote how you handle your tenants security deposits. Greed has nothing to do with not taking a security deposit and you must have the perfect tenant screening process. I have had tenants pass my hard screening process only to cost me big dollars for no mistake on my part but because they used Chicago laws to screw the landlord. Just because they could! I am so happy I had insurance. Also correct me if I am wrong, but a 1099 is not required for earnings under a few dollars? A security deposit is now used as a means of screwing a landlord so don't call us greedy if we want to protect ourselves from this attack.

— On the neighbor message Apartment 4 Rent
6:32 p.m.
TT, I disagree. It is the politicians that force Landlords to use move in fees and not greed. If what you write is what you are doing with your tenants security deposit, when you get forced into housing court, you will wish you used move in fee instead. Hope your tenants are not reading this or you will find out the hard way.

That location is going through the roof and will be very expensive soon. On the other hand, notice the row houses down the street and taking up entire blocks on the surrounding blocks? They are low income projects and house the majority of the gangs in the area. They have been changing their rules to live in these projects and having the police come over several times is now grounds for eviction which is forcing the gangs out. It is a work in progress, now it is up to you to decide if it is worth it. The park is beautiful, The Bloomingdale Trail is out of this world and I have raised my family here, all totally worth it.

All two of them? You obviously don't know the definition of a gang. I have seen the old timers, hobbling along the sidewalk, not scaring anyone. You credibility was never good to begin with and your claims only prove how far from the truth you really are. Again the areas you name are not anywhere close to being a gang nightmare as it would be if gang numbers had grown by 10 fold. The last true gang cesspool is Englewood but due to the population drop in that neighborhood, I would say gangs are down 10 fold.

I on the other hand can give address after address of buildings that use to house the worst gangs in Humboldt Park and have been rehabbed and are now highly sought after by the new law abiding people moving in.

ll74, still not answering my questions I see. I know you can't because it will show your true colors, just like BB will not either. Do you read what you write? At what expense? The majority of people living in Humboldt Park over a decade ago were poor. Now the property owners who knew how to save, manage and invest their money are seeing the pay off of buying in Humboldt Park when no one else would. Building a better community made a lot of poor people rich. They now sell and move to a better neighborhood than what Humboldt park was when they purchased, The American Dream. Your lawn analogy is flawed, if I took care of your lawn, what would you learn? If I told you how to take care of your lawn, you would tell me I have no right to dictate to you how to live. How many of your neighbors lawns do you take care of? Again, Humboldt Park has the HIGHEST concentration of low income housing than ANY OTHER community in Chicago. They will NEVER be PUSHED out!

As for poor people fleeing, Humboldt Park has the highest concentration of low income housing than any other community in Chicago! They are not going anywhere! This is what makes Humboldt Park the best community in Chicago! No one group rules over the park and tells everyone else what to do. No segregation as in most other neighborhoods and we get along.

RR, sarcasm escapes me at times, so thank you for explaining it to me. The building in this post needs a lot more than just some TLC, as the seller points out in the listing. The way I read it, it should be condemned. I have done exactly to my building as you are doing to yours. You, along with developers, is just what Humboldt Park needs to become a vibrant community again. There is plenty of room for both in Humboldt park without a doubt. I am glad to have you as a neighbor. I also don't see what others see in these new stack boxes they are building, but they are selling big time, so I am out of touch with this taste also. Set for life in my book, is just what you wrote. You were able to buy as prices are rising out of reach. You now own, what others will pay twice or three times as much to possess. As the cost of living goes up, you will pass that cost onto your tenant. The cost of insurance and property taxes are no longer a worry for you. When it comes to your living conditions, the only worry you should have is to keep investing into your property so you will attract the high rent paying tenant. For every dollar you invest into your building, you will probably make five to ten in return. You are set for life, not quitting work and eating bon bons all day, but set for life all the same. 
Just to let you know, UR is most likely Sydney. This is one of the extremely few times Sydney has ever asked a civil question so I answered Sydney's question also in this post.

rp, most of my neighbors who have cashed out, have moved out if the state. The four families living in a collapsing building most likely will not stay in the neighborhood and the couple that can afford a million dollar home will not care about taxes at all.
ll74, you have not answered my questions but I have answered yours. "do as I say but not as I do", is how you behave, shame on you. Do you not remember just a decade ago what Humboldt Park was like, gangs, drugs, violence and death? Crime was everywhere because because criminals lived here, cheap dumps to live in and no one called the police because of fear or they just did not care! If you can't manage your money, it is not my job to do so. We live in a Capitalistic society and yes green is high on the list, if you do not like this, move out of the country. By the way, when I purchased my property, there was no lawns, only weeds and clay on the entire block. Now, the entire block has grass and beautiful flowers. It is nice that the new people who have moved in care about their lawns and property and the people who never cared have moved away. Are you like A.M. and want the gang bangers and criminals to stay in Humboldt Park and stop gentrification at any cost? If you call having parents that cared about my upbringing, "privileged institutional", than I am guilty of that.

I have read many of your posts in other blogs and find them very informative but this one is so shockingly demeaning, I do not know where to begin! I did not know you thought this way about your neighbors. Why is it all about race with some people, I do not know.
Now let's get back to the point of this thread. On another thread, about people fleeing Illinois for the last seven years, an EBer pointed out how single family homes are replacing multi units in Humboldt park, decreasing the population. Another EBer requested the source of this information and none was offered. I have read many stories on how The Bloomingdale Trail has started a housing boom around it, and wrote I would post one if I found them. I can no longer find that thread so I started this one, posting what I found listed for sale next to the trail. I will repeat myself again, I want to see all of the criminals and gang bangers moved out of Humboldt Park and I don't care what race they are, I want to see more home ownership and I don't care what race they are! This is why HP is coming back to life in such a huge way so please stop using the race card when this has nothing to do with the race of law abiding citizens.

My neighbors of color own their property, so they are not going anywhere unless they want to cash out big time. This was one of the major reasons I moved my family here and it will not change in my life time. Except for the gangs leaving. HP needs more property owners and less renters that don't care about the neighborhood because they can move at any time. Multi cultural community is the greatest thing about Humboldt Park and not only one culture ruling over the park.

Glenn has a point, and I agree, Chicago is in trouble as long as these Democrats keep raising taxes to pay bills and fill the pockets of their friends! Now as for Humboldt Park, The Bloomingdale Trail is proof how if tax payer money is spend wisely, in a neighborhood in desperate need of resources it can come back to life. Now where violent crime, vacant buildings and lots use to be, development returns, earning badly need property taxes, with people who know how to build wealth instead of wasting it and demanding more from the government. The Bloomingdale Trail, like the Gold Coast, will make Humboldt park weather any problem the economy might have! All the million dollar homes and sky scrapers being built by developers around it is proof of that!

I will try to find the new story on developers now building million dollar plus, single family homes along The Bloomingdale Trail. It was out just a few days ago, so it is not BS propaganda. There are several expensive town home projects sold out within a block of The Bloomingdale Trail where vacant lots use to be! More than enough proof of the area changing without a source and an indicator of who is moving in. Al, what " militant means to stop gentrification" are you willing to do? Sounds like a threat to me.

BI, I am going to wait until I have learned all I can before I make that decision. I was leaning toward Bernie also until his remakes about CPD when he stopped here. 
Correct, I have earned my pension but now it is in jeopardy because Democrats are bankrupting the city! No Republicans to blame in City Hall or I would blame them to. Kool-aide drinkers keep voting (or not voting) the same corrupt politicians back into office! CPD never has benefited a lot by that corruption! Did you know that CPD does not have a union and it is against Federal law to strike or have a union? I remember getting a half of a percent raise one year and many officers pay checks went down because of it! So no union to fight like hell for anything, we begged the last Mayor for the tokens he would let us have and now it looks like he took our pension money with him when he left! Why do voters still back Democrats in Chicago when they took everything they could, bankrupt the city, closed schools, police stations and library's? Hell, they vote in dead and indicted politicians, no term limits, no ethics laws, many have family members as Judges and Lawyers in the Cook Co. courts so no worries about being arrested or even prosecuted. An Alderman's wife sits on the Illinois Supreme Court, what do you think she does for her party? I am going to vomit now, later.

Your not the first to paint me with that brush, shame on you. I am trying to get you and the rest of the kool-aide drinkers here to start thinking! A Republican can not fix this mess you Democrats have made here in Chicago, but getting just one to run will be an eye opening experience to them. That might make them think that it is time to listen to the people of Chicago instead of dictating to them how the city should be run. I never wrote elect a Republican, and they can be just as bad when there are no term limits to stop Chicago kind of corruption. Again a closed mind is a terrible waste and I will vote for the best person for the job instead of what a party tells me who to vote for. Good luck to you and the future you make for yourself.

Chicago's population was growing before and the weather was the same! The difference now is the bills are due and it is time to pay the piper! Our last Mayor knew how to sell off all of Chicago's assets and kick the bills down to the next Mayor as he runs away with all of the tax payers money. People call Rahm a Republican because his is attempting to balance Chicago budget, so to be a good Democrat, you must tax and over spend BILLIONS! To be an EVIL Republican, all you have to do is push for a balanced budget that spends less than taxes take in? Just keep drinking the kool-aide and voting for these Democrats just like in Detroit!

Chicago is the most segregated city in America but Humboldt Park is not and that is what makes HP the best neighborhood to live in.

SC, the two single family homes on Kedzie between Division and Crystal are being build by the same developer. The building to the North with the fancy curves, the developer will live in and the other will be sold. Every time I talk to him, the price goes up on the one to be sold, and he said both were supposed to be finished by the end of the year. Workers show up only a few times a week so your guess is as good as mine as to when they will be completed. I don't know what you mean by "party garage". If you mean the one at 3214 W. Division, the owner has been working on it for four years and I can not figure what he is doing. I think that it is the signs of the times, that all the vacant lots are finally being developed with mega single family homes.

A guy wacked out on PCP threatening people in a BK with a knife, no police, just you! I wonder how any of you would deal with him? This has nothing to do with race, if he were white, the officer would have done the same thing following his training in a high stress and life threatening incident.

A lot of questions to answer. First, you think when blacks kill blacks they go to jail for life, your on PCP! There is a spike in murders in black neighborhoods now that police do nothing there or completely avoid the areas! Black lives matter scaring the police is why blacks are killing each other more than ever right now and get away with it.Do you not watch the new on it? 80 minuets of video missing from BK, THINK!!! That means for over 80 minuets the police tried to arrest this guy without using deadly force prior to the ten seconds of video everyone here has convicted to officer by! Looks like a lot more needs to be learned before judgement. Reports stated he was waving a knife in a threatening manner, I saw that, most didn't????!!!?? He turned his head toward the officer and the officer fired, I saw that! The video is from behind so no one but the officers saw what he was doing with the knife at that very moment. So where does the false reports come into play? Police are trained that someone on PCP is extremely hard to stop, EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Now the knife gun, what the officer was thinking, why did he shoot him on the ground, only that officer can answer those questions. I have a question for all of you, if it was you or a loved one who was the officer attempting to stop this subject from injuring or killing others, how would you have handled it?

As for, "If you think that's tough to watch, try watching cop after cop walk scott free after executing your friends and loved ones", how many of your loved ones have police killed? I bet not one! Exactly how many citizens were killed by police who were not wacked on drugs, without a gun, knife or weapon of any kind, the number is extremely low in the last DECADE!!!!

It is easier to change the boundaries than to stop the violence that happens non-stop on the West side.

Crime would drop tremendously in Humboldt Park if it ended at Central Park on the West. Many of my neighbors and I wish that the boundaries were changed to reflect that.

VPG, As CA is focusing on bad parenting in this thread, I focused on the gang-banger part of this thread. I never use "only" or that this only happens to gang-bangers. If this thread did not point out the gang relationship, I would not have brought it up. I just used this as another glaring reason that having anything to do with a gang-banger almost always ends up in death and/or destruction. I can't figure out why anyone would ignore the 800 Lb. gorilla staring them right in the face and focus on the smallest point of the thread? There are people that write that gangs are good for Humboldt Park and do not want them to be forced out by gentrification!!

Why would you not do the same? The news keeps telling the stories of children of gang bangers getting killed as the banger parent gets shot at! Hello!!! Why are the children not taken away from them for the safety of the children? How many more children must die before anyone stands up for their right to live in peace and have the ability to grow up?

Fuarain, Your statement is so far out there, I don't know how to respond to it! How about you reread my statement "S L O W L Y" and address me on what I wrote and not what exploded in your head. If you live with a child molester, don't be surprised if your children are molested. The same can be said about living with a gang banger and the violence that surrounds them.

Craig, I assume nothing, and base my findings on what has happened to Wicker Park, Buck Town and so on. How many gangs do you now see in those neighborhoods? As for needing cleaning, were you around HP in the 60's thru 90's? The placed needed massive cleaning, it was a war zone! You could have purchased three flat grey stones on the park for under a hundred thousand but no one wanted them. Where people do not call the police, you find gangs! Diversity, to me means different people with different economic levels, not to exclude the six figure income range, which we had none! The rest already have many safety nets but not the criminal. Last, the city is now finishing six, first time buyer homes in HP, on the West side of the park. I do not know how to find the requirements needed to buy one or where.

When only counting the people that gentrification will force out of HP, I believe it will be 10 gang bangers forced out to every one good person that can not stay. Long term property owners as well as low income families that live in subsidized housing already have a safety net so they are not effected by property values. I don't count the property owners who now take the massive profit from selling there homes to live the American dream somewhere else. Gang bangers are not smart and don't prepare for economic change nor can they handle people moving in that call the police. They only prey on the weak and the defenseless and the new people moving in are not either! With property prices like these, bangers gotta go!!!

Craig, No, never wrote that only gangs will be forced out. Unfortunately, a few good people will also be priced out. I believe it will be 10 to 1, 10 being gangs to every one good family that it will happen to. "my son has told me that "Humboldt Park is the best place in the world to live," ", your son is correct! The neighborhood will stay diverse and of all income levels because of all the low income projects that flood HP. The politicians have done their best to wipe the middle class from HP but those who purchased in HP back when nobody wanted to, now reap the benefits of their hard labor. They should, don't you think? You would like to see the same thing happen where you are buying now right? Your not buying where the neighborhood is getting worst and you will lose money are you? Have you seen the East side of the park? It is almost all the very rich or the very poor and little to no middle class! On the West side of the park, we fought this from happening, stopped the flood of low income projects making up entire blocks, demanded affordable signal family homes and property ownership instead of mass rentals. I think we are the better side. There are six first time buyer homes just now being finished here and it sounds like you fit the requirements to purchase one. I would welcome you as a neighbor and your children could play with my Grandchildren. Now that would be great. WW, sorry you feel the way, Craig and I believe HP is the best place to put down roots and already have. I raised my children here and now they are raising their children here too.

Sounds and looks bad! This will give HP a bad reputation, but that is what they want. Destroy the park and gentrification will not happen. At park meeting last night, no pumpkins for pumpkin fest because no money. Another fest gone or cut to nothing. I pointed out that Riot Fest always donated money and pumpkin fest would go on but only one elderly women said don't need them. So screw the children so we can keep Riot Fest out, and the swimming pond, and the up grading to the park and bringing businesses back to the neighborhood, and.......

Every statement made here is the reason to vote Republican next time or a least get a Republican to run! Put the fear of being voted out in their heads instead of the uneducated Chicago voter will never vote Republican because of years of drinking our kool-aide! VOTE and they have to listen, DON'T, and you get used and ignored like we have in Chicago for DECADES! See what is happening in the Republican debates? Even Republicans are sick of these career politicians and are making their views clear for everyone to see. Chuy would have made things worst and taxed us even higher till we were Detroit! Rahm, the lesser of two evils.

"CA", stores target customers. That is why you don't see a Cermak down town and why NOW HP needs a Mariano's. 
How many American flags can you have displayed on one property?
I am a Vet, served my country with distinction! I display my pride in my country by displaying the American flag. I need to display more.
Rakarwowski can't hep (help) his racist views. Race has nothing to do with calling gang bangers scum and law abiding people good. You want senseless violence, you are scum! You want to help your neighbors make HP a peaceful place to raise a family, you are good. I don't see how that view is racist? O wait, I forgot who wrote that.
Now, Allen, what will be your property taxes in four years, how many times have you been arrested, are you a felon? You live in (hide in) a glass house, don't throw stones. You don't intimidate me! What do you think of my wife's flowers and fish pond. All my neighbors love them, take pictures and the preschool around the corner bring the children over to see the fish. My neighbor has done the same and her building is awesome. I am very proud of my building, everyone come stop by and see how hard I worked with my neighbors to clean up HP. Sorry, you can't do the same UB because you threatened so many in HP. You better keep hiding, bad people where you live.

" Carol Ann", I have no problem with Cermak. I enjoy what they have to offer and been there several times. There are several, or close to it, around HP. I want a FULL SERVICE grocery store like I wrote, Strak n Van Til, Pete's fresh Produce or even a Mariano's. Why are we limited in the HP neighborhood? Why are we treated like second class citizens and not like East of Western. HP has changed so much and is so diverse that Cermak doesn't cut it any more. The last census around HP proves that the area has gentrified to the point that we deserve more diversity in places to shop. I don't understand why what I wrote was considered an attack, I only responded to BB's inconsiderate question in kind. Diversity is what makes HP the best place to raise a family from my point of view. Anyone replying to flood the area with only Cermak foods gets the response I gave. I don't like Jewel either any more, it use to be be good but not anymore. I am just tired of traveling East of Western to find what everyone else in Chicago expects in shops to find what they need. Why are we in HP treated this way? We work, have families, pay our taxes, want to live in peace but always seem to get the short end of the stick. I am sorry if anyone took what I wrote the wrong way. I only want the best for the HP area.

The rise in property values means the criminal element in HP will be forced out! Gentrification will cure HP of it's criminal history by moving good people in.

I don't care what happened in Cabrini Green in the 80's, and like Allen sitting on million dollar buildings porches, he soon leaves never to be seen again. Bangers can stop by as long as they leave just as quickly, that does not bother me. Do you know how soon you will be moving? Good luck on your move. I am happy for you. Me.

If you look at it that way, my family sold out their history when they moved to America and left Europe. Everyone who came to America did too. It is called progressing and if you don't change, history is your fate. Gangs love vacant lots weather they hang out or not and it is a sign that nobody wants to buy in that area. Abandoned vehicles, stripped and then burned was common place in the vacant lots around me till a few years ago. I understand you not wanting to give your address but why not a close major intersection or at least North of/ West of the park? If you don't want to, I will not press the issue.

Deb, no this building is not the norm, but someone will buy it and big change will occur.
My family always owned a multi unit building, so we were never affected by taxes. You want to own property and want to keep it? Just like any other money making business, you have to close if you do not make a profit. If you do not prepare for change, you become part of history. I never saw a 3.5 million dollar building being built West of Damen! BOOM, here it is, we all who now live here must prepare for the big change that is happening NOW!

I never wrote that the Republicans were not to blame down state but in Chicago (which started it all), only Democrats have been in charge for decades. Term limits, I say we only need ten Alderman and a code of ethics for City Hall would be extremely helpful. They should get no pensions! The best thing to ever happen to Illinois Constitution law or our Police and Fire workers would be screwed now. Now remember, Detroit went bankrupt and with that their police and fire are going to loose their pensions! Hope they are happy for voting Democratic! If Chicago voters would show that they will think before they vote, everything would change here. Do you think that could happen? Democratic politicians in Chicago don't and there is proof time and time again they have nothing to worry about. Without a Republican running in Chicago, we are lost.

For decades Chicago Democrats have taken the tax payer for all they could and WE let them (tear up a money making air port at 2 A.M. and turn it into a park and name it after your wife), so now you pay for being an uneducated voter. So don't cry, you asked for it! One last note, pension reform is not the answer and the Illinois Supreme Court and the Illinois Constitution ordered that it can not be changed (thank the unions for that).

At the last beat meeting, it was brought up that there are a few gang families still on the 3300 W Blocks of Le Moyne and Beach. Gangs members are making their presents known because they are feeling the pressure of gentrification. Several arrests have been made and guns have been recovered as gun fire has increased as they try to stop law abiding people from moving in. Police state that because these gang members own property, it is much harder to make arrests and get them out of the neighborhood. Neighbors are asked to dial 911 and give an accurate description of gang members doing criminal activity. Police have stepped up patrols and this is the result. Thank You C.P.D..

I think the stores on Division Street with signs that read "NO RIOT FEST IN HUMBOLDT PARK" were the main target even though one had "SORRY" on it also. The bar on the 3000 West block of North Ave. was also named because the owner spoke out against RF with Charlie at a surprise park meeting.

I use to go to Division Street Bar and Grill until they had to close because all the gangs bangers from a few doors down the street chased away the customers. Now there is the Chinese place, that has been there forever and now the Mexican pizza joint across the street from the closed place I went to. It appears that the Mexican places are doing much better now and don't attract motorcycle gangs or bangers so they are probably best to go to. They also welcome everyone. Jen I knew you hang out there because you wrote your part of that scene. I hope one day everyone will be welcome there but until then, it's for Allen and his friends and others will continue to avoid the no mans land that haters have made it to be.

Seven years ago they stopped construction of the million dollar homes on the 1800 N. block of California because on one wanted in. Now The Bloomingdale Trail is open, all of the million dollar home are sold and gang activity is at it's lowest for decades! You write there is no difference? In what bubble are you living? There is construction every where, towers are going up at California and Milwaukee and you think it is the same as SEVEN YEARS AGO. Open your eyes, the bad old days are over and in a few years people will be talking about the only fest that still has shooting in HP like you show in your video links. You can't stop the change that is already here no matter what you write.

Thanks HP Neighbor. Bush, if you have read my posts, I point out that gang violence spikes certain times every year in HP! Each year the violence is less as the gangs are forced out and good people move in. Do you remember what was on those six lots before gentrification started? It was two vacant lots and four abandoned stores. One was a butcher who left all the meat to spoil and the city had to clean it up with a HASMAT team! These buildings are a blessing to HP and proves that businesses are willing to invest here again. Prosperity has returned, we still have work ahead of us to clean HP but the job is getting easier with every good neighbor who moves in and helps out. Time to stop complaining about HP and start helping to make it a better place to raise a family again. HP is an amazing park, Welcome, I know you will enjoy it as much as I do.

Jen, I never mentioned PR Fest and you are the only one who wrote that this fest is full of drugs. I have been there and never saw that. Also to write this fest is as bad as a fest that has shoot outs during the parade and non-stop gang violence on Division as videos show, proves what you are doing. Can you show me a video of a shoot out at any other fest in Chicago, do you think that fest should be stopped? Why did anyone go there from my post? A friend invited me to go this year and I posted it. If anyone thinks this is a stab a PR Fest, that just shows how insecure they are about the violence that happens at that fest every year and try to make other events look bad so PR Fest doesn't appear as the worst!

It is also great because I know that it got to you and there is nothing you can do about it! How many banger friends did you loss from this building? How many doors down from where you live is it? Maybe next door! The new residents will be watching your every move and calling the police every time you do as you always have in the past. You have been band from EB how many times now? Do you feel the pressure to get out? Even EB is tired of you. Your property taxes are going to soar because of all the politicians stole every city workers pension money and these 900K$ buildings will raise your property value. No money for flipping buildings to rent to gang bangers! You are so gone but just don't know it yet! Bye-Bye banger, so happy to see you go!

Gang bangers are scum now, I don't care about history! Gangs do no good today and writing that there is some good in them is a waste of some ones life. I will agree it is better to help a banger out of a gang than lock them up but as you can read, some don't want out and only want to commit crimes! These violent acts have been happening around the area for about a month now! The description of the offenders has been the same in every case, a group of three male black teens mainly attacking white women! Now let us all be on the look out for these criminals, call the police quickly, give a accurate description and get them locked up before they violently attack a defenseless woman. How about we work together to do that to help clean up our neighborhood!

My PR neighbors who own their property are not going anywhere as long as they want too. Many of those same law abiding PR home owners helped clean up HP and move the criminals out so they are also gentrifying the area.

Here we go again, Whites are evil....blah....blah....blah! This guy is truly the best representative for how HP was just a few years ago! Does anyone remember when the Polish-Americans were forced out by who is getting forced out now! He has no problems with that! I remember before gentrification came to HP, gangs ran the park, murder, shootings and body parts pulled from the lake! This individual believes those were the good times in HP. Now gentrification rears it's ugly head, gangs move out, crime rate drops dramatically, parks become accessible to families again, great fests happen in the park and The Bloomingdale Trail opens! He wants to stop this from happening because whites are the problem by moving in. Read who praise him in destroying what we all (HP residents) worked so hard to build. It was not only whites who made HP what it is today but all the law abiding neighbors who stood up to the criminals and stated together, WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS ANY MORE! See what beautiful things happen when we all work together for the common goal of peace. This individual, Charlie and the ones who support them want to divide this community and what better way than write WHITES ARE THE PROBLEM! Sounds like something stated by a German leader about Jews during WWII doesn't it? This is the hardest and most serious test for residents of HP in decades and I hope we can pass it with honors and not fall into the depths of division that these individuals want us too.

That did not happen here on this thread so why bring it up? We know the answer so please move on. EB allows neighbors to work together to make their community a better place to live. It also allows everyone to read what wack jobs write on both sides of the topic. Knowledge is power, and learning about gang banger thoughts along with their sympathizers will lead to ridding HP of their violence! Calling a gang banger scum shows others that they have neighbors who are not afraid of gangs or to call the police and have them arrested for their crimes. This frightens the krap out of them because they are truly cowards and fear the law abiding citizen who stands up to them most of all. Why do you think they all move away when an area gentrifies?

Three shows, 70,000 people each, no shootings. One weekend, maybe 10,000 a day, shootings all around the park! Middle of the day, middle of the continuing parade, so much so, many people made videos showing them! Even grass was killed! Why doesn't anyone stop this yearly cycle of violence?

What would you call gang bangers who shoot and kill 7 year old children? Bangers are scum but the city is now working with the worst of them to guide them away from the killings and help them become good citizens again. 14000 criminals commit 70 to 80 % of all crimes in Chicago. The city is now working to assist them to get out of gangs before they become the next victim or some innocent child that may be around them during the next shooting. They all can't be helped but if only 20% are saved, think of all the innocent lives saved as well.

Downtown, they would be called theft mobs. My daughter saw a group of black males, between 11 and 16 years of age hiding among parked vehicles in the park the other day. She noticed one scream now, and the others jump up , throwing things at passing vehicles. They all then ran out of the park W/B. A woman was passing on a bike and one of them ran up to her and punched her in the head. She screamed "WHAT WAS THAT FOR?", and rode away as they ran away laughing! Hope this is not the start of West side violence happening in HP.

The majority of HP know what divided the community no matter what race we are and we together can fix it instead of joining in on what they started.

Also talked to CPD at CAPS meeting, they are aware of the on going gang problem on 1600-1700 blks of Talman and will continue to arrest all gang bangers who break the law there. I learned that there was a lot of gang activity that night and every time police responded the bangers would flee like the low life's they are. Law abiding neighbors on those blocks are requested to dial 911 every time gangs gather. We can clean up HP if we work together to rid the neighborhood of gangs.

The three strike rule was put into place to take sentencing out of the hands of corrupt or inept judges. No fantasy land, just reality. For someone who has been locked up before, most of your posts come from fantasy land without a doubt! The story reports, he lived on the next block from you, do you know what gang he was in? Did he support others living with him that will have to leave the neighborhood because of lost income he provided? Your neighbors must be very happy that a gun pointing criminal has been removed from the area and make it better for the law abiding families to move in. There can be only so few criminals left living by you now that they are being watched by everyone else very closely. I am sure that someone is calling the police on them as soon as they even J-walk, as they must stick out like a sore thumb now. It is just getting better and better in HP every day and no matter what you write, you can not stop it now. One day, reality will sink in with you, till then, just keep counting the bangers being jailed and moving out because law abiding citizens will not put up with their garbage any longer! When you exit your house, do you feel like someone is watching you? I remember working in dangerous neighborhoods and everyone walked around spinning their heads to look out for violence around them!

Maybe, if he had only committed one felony, but it is reported he committed several felonies! He is most likely a felon already, so this would put him under the three strikes ruling. That means LIFE. Sucks to be him! Now let's just say he gets out in two years. That means, the neighborhood is better off and peaceful without him for two years. After that, he probably will not be able to return to the neighborhood because it will have changed so much faster with him gone. Either way, this criminal and bangers like him will only be a memory soon enough. Bye-Bye bangers, so happy to see you go.

I never knew how fantastic the homes were on the East end of the trail are and can not wait for the building boom to make it to the West end. Hats off to Rahm for taking an eye sore of an abandoned rail line use mostly by criminals to evade police and turn it into a park for families to enjoy in peace. This will definitely bring the neighborhoods together and back to life and a major blow to the criminal element and forcing them out of the area. I noticed that all access points are under video surveillance which will definitely keep law breakers thinking twice of doing anything stupid on the trail or use as an escape route.

I went and Maldonado repeated he was anti-Riot Fest because that is what the majority of the community wants. I asked if it was proven that the majority of the community wants Riot Fest would he change his mind, his reply was he would still be against Riot Fest! He also stated that Riot Fest organizers had not approached him since September but I saw Max there last week so he must have forgotten that. This appears to be a dead end.

There is no question also about all the jobs and economic development you will be destroying if you succeed in kicking RF out of HP!

If he had showed up at meetings and learned what RF is doing to address all of his concerns, we would not be here now. He just showed up one day and stated he wanted RF out of HP. Never asked anyone at the meeting for input and he is still wrong about half of what he is arguing about. When you don't know what you are talking about, refuse to listen to reason and take the stand "MY WAY, WHICH IS THE HIGHWAY ONLY" this is not a nice way to treat your neighbors. How can you care about the park but not be apart of meetings about the park? You want to help, be a voice of reason not a dictator, ordering HP residents to submit to way only! I believe if you do not listen to your neighbors on the HPAC and attend meetings, why should anyone listen to you about the welfare of the park!

RF has been at HPAC meetings months before every event, now four years in a row. Charlie has been at the last two HPAC meetings, never seen before in the last decade! If he cares about the park so much, why hasn't he been attending HPAC in the last ten years? I don't believe he cares about the park at all and this is just his way to stop gentrification.

I agree HP will never be all one race but that is exactly why it is the best place to raise a family. Diversity is what makes HP, HP! We have so many different cultures Living here, making their own American dream come true. The people who stayed in school, got a good job, saved money, purchased property and are law abiding live here. They are not leaving unless they want to! What do these people have in common? They want to live here in peace, no bangers shooting up the place and the ability to coexist! No one race can tell another to get out or stay out so let us keep working to make HP better than Lincoln Park in which ANY law abiding people can live.

It is only dangerous to the banger because us law abiding neighbors will not cower and hind from them any more! With every garbage store that get closed, it is one less hang out for bangers.

He did it again, all about himself and the good old banger days! This thread is about Shuttered Von Humboldt School Building to become Mixed-Use Residences! It is unlawful for a building to be for TEACHERS ONLY. A restaurant not on a main street, not likely. This is just a way to keep this building and the area out of a developers hands and keep HP down. The city is broke and if the building was placed onto the open market and sold to the highest bidder, the city would make huge $$$$$$!!! That would also raise the the tax base so property taxes would not have to be raised.

Underfunding any budget is theft in my book. Wisconsin and Indiana Republicans funded their states pensions and they are doing just fine right now! Chicago Democrats stop pension funding decades ago and down state Republicans figured, if Dem.s can get away with it so shall we! When Republicans act like Democrats, all tax payers are going to regret it in the end! It is not one party's fault but the "I want ice cream voter" who let this occur.

Handouts- money, jobs etc. given to groups (voters, unions, special interests etc.) who did not work for them and we do not need them to keep the city/state in the black and working. 
A pension that was earned over decades and paid into by the worker is NOT a hand out and my pension is not HUGE by any account! You need to know something about the topic before you write about it!

You and Allen related? It is the two of you who need to "get real" whatever that means to you! Rahm's fiscal actions are definitely Republican and it is the best thing about him. Hand out receiving Democrats will hate him, taxes will go up and Chicago will be saved because educated people (not racist) voted yesterday. Fiscally responsibly people, no matter what their color will save Chicago! 
Toni Preckwinkle replaced that piece of trash who was destroying Cook County and his fathers good name with his hand outs and stealing. She made cuts and many Republican moves to save the County budget. She would make a great Chicago Mayor!

Sorry to read such narrow minded racist garbage. To vote for someone based on the color of their skin is racist even if it is to prove the voter is not racist! Chicago needs a leader that will stop the hand outs until we can pay for them again. This will aggravate all Chicago Democrats because they have been spoon feed tax money until now. We are BROKE!!! Now deal with it! Maybe it is time to vote Republican?

This is proof positive that Chuy's son cost him the election. Chuy would have probably received more than 6% more votes if it was not for him taking care of his gang banger son. Well now I expect to see the gang banger flight out of Chicago and will be happy to help move any bangers out of Chicago! The gang bangers choice for Mayor lost! Bye-Bye bangers!

Fantastic pubs over there and not a banger was seen in any of them I went to. The pubs were packed with the people you hate. Bangers are disappearing faster than I thought.

It everyone's fault but their own. Chuy has been in politics before he had his son so all that stuff is just smoke. What about the majority of parents who raised their children in that environment and their children did not join a gang? They know how to raise their children better than Chuy I guess. Most parents disown their children when they keep up criminal activity time and time again, but not Chuy. He keeps covering for his sons criminal actions and now it is costing him, maybe the election! Crime does not pay!

Rahm inherited a broke city, under funded budget and the last Mayor sold off the very life blood of city income (parking meters).

Does anyone living in Chicago believe taxes are not going up to fill the pension deficit very soon.

Susan S., Rahm did not raise taxes, CPS made the raises. I was wrong, property taxes have gone up under Rahm but not by Rahm. Please read "Emanuel not ruling out raising CPS property tax limits" in which they write "For each of the past two years, CPS has raised its tax rates to the maximum allowed under the cap. On Monday, schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett said the issue was "still a work in progress" when asked about raising taxes above the cap." Remember Rahm inherited our budget debt from the prior tax and spend, kick the can down the road (For 75 years with the parking meters) mayor. Do you think taxes will not go up under Chuy? He has already promised 1.9 BILLION in spending with no idea how to fund it.

Mike in politics, change does not happen in a few years. Rahm has been making hard decisions with what the Democrats left for him over decades of abuse.

Chuy does not have a clue what the city's problems really are. Like hiring 1000 police pfficer with what?

As for bangers returning to the hood they no longer live in, life is short, very short. Being caught on a street with no brother bangers living on it usually is a death sentence to that banger. Again that dead banger is one less banger in the hood and soon there will be none. Go ahead, keep talking trash, with every good law abiding citizen to move into HP a dozen bangers move out. No dreaming, it's happening right now all around us. It is fantastic to be a part of it. Life is good.

Thank you, everyone on this thread on EB. Allen has turned into a broken record and only repeats the same garbage over and over again, going nowhere. I hope everyone who has read this thread has some insight now on how twisted gang bangers views really are. It seem to me Allen thinks gangs are like boy scouts, out to help their neighbors as they victimize everyone else. Very twisted indeed! Gangs are everywhere, it was not long ago when they caused havoc in De Paul and Old Town. I know, I was there then. What Allen will not admit and everyone else here knows, is the gangs in HP will follow their brothers who were in De Paul and Buck Town and very soon will be gone. Allen says he owns his house, (I'm sorry for his neighbors) but he will let the wrong gang brother into his home and like so many other gang families have, get involved in some criminal activity and loose that to. Gentrification isn't such a bad thing when it forces the last gang banger to move out of HP, just as it did in De Paul. I am moving forward into another thread and believe I did my part with this thread in helping clean up HP. Now "Let Peace Prevail" in HP, and don't forget, April 18 is Clean Up HP Day.

Those murals are all gone followed soon by the gang bangers themselves. The bangers that are still here are a joke and are laughed at most of the time, a mere shadow of the way it was. HP can be a gang haven again just as much as Wicker Park, Buck Town and now Logan Square can. Never going to happen!

It appears that almost everyone on EB sees right though your garbage and no one is scared of your or your friends This is why I started this thread and I am so glad it is working so well thanks to your input. Please keep it up so other can learn how not to be scared by a gang banger and how pitiful gang bangers really are.

Now that is out there! Like a bike trail has ever turn into a place to get heroine and gang members use it as a place to gather! Please reread my comment above of all the reasons this will not happen or has ever happen on any other bike trail in America. You are not going to irritate me or anyone else by calling police officers names. You are just making yourself look bad and much less creditable if that is even possible. I was at 1421's beat meeting last week, sorry you were not there to talk down about gentrification like you say you do. Just more of your garbage about what you do I guess.

Allen you will never get it, just like the last gang banger in the hood saying the bad old days will return. Look around you, it has already happened, the good people are staying and the criminals are moving away faster then you will ever admit. Once that 600k house sells on the next block, it is not going down in value! There are dozens being built all around you if you had not noticed! The people moving in are NOT scared of you or frightened by the cameras because they know you and the cameras will gone very soon just like all the neighborhoods around HP! They are not going to tear down The Bloomingdale Trail and tourists are going to come from all around the world to see it just like they do for High Line trail in NYC. The Bloomingdale Trail is even larger and longer. In fact, the largest elevated trail in America and you think your gang banger friends will stop this? You are fooling yourself, wait until opening day, I know when you see all the law abiding people there to enjoy it, you and that other person will go ballistic. I will be dancing down the trail with my family knowing that this is the end of gang banger control in HP. Last thing, being poor does not make you turn into a criminal, if so we would have been overrun when the bubble burst in 2008! You can not scare people who are educated and know BS when they see it. Hello Bloomingdale Trail, Bye-Bye gang bangers!

Criminals will run from The Bloomingdale Trail and not want to go anywhere near it because of the limited exits. Everyone on this trail will have cell phones to call the police and also law abiding citizens have the right to carry now so that person with the gun might not be the mugger! Sucks to be a criminal in a nice neighborhood because there is no one who will hide you from the police as you run away like a wuss. The Bloomingdale Trail will never turn into mugger alley, it WILL cause criminals to move away from it though! I think I know why a few here are against it! A gang banger feels like a big man only if surrounded by other gang bangers. When the gang banger is the last gang banger in the hood, he/she is only pitiful fool waiting to be shot, locked up or move away like the rest.

Looks like the pizza joint and the children's hair salon went bye bye. I talked to the workers doing the new front and they said they did not know of any business opening up there. I watched them place the for rent sign back into the window (not good). My best guess is that the new owners are having a very hard time finding any takers and have made the store front look great from the pill box look it had before. The new glass makes the street look like it is gentrifying but one door means only one business. I don't see any one paying the price for the whole store. I will keep everyone posted of any changes.
Anything is better than that ghetto store with it lousy owners that was there before!

Charlie, I know of your other posts. You must just change your mind a lot. You wrote, " I appreciate your comments and the civilized nature of your response.". Communication is the answer to all problems but it is harder when one flip flops in a discussion. I appreciate your comments and try to be respectful to everyone. Calling names distracts from the facts for a conversation and is wrong. YES, we need the RF public relations machine here in HP to solve issues. Most people who do not live here believe it to be like it was in the 80's and 90's. Gang infested, drug dealers all over the park and not safe for anyone. For some reason there are people in power that want that lie to continue. HP has changed for the better over the last decade "people cleaned up HP" and those days are over and will not return. RF brings people into HP and they see for themselves how beautiful and family friendly the area really is. This solves most of our problems. RF brings in new businesses and developers. People are now saying how they want to move in and that HP is one of the top ten places in America. Even Mayor Rahm stated HP is the hottest neighborhood in the city. RF is not the only reason but it is a major reason all this is happening in HP! 
THANK YOU RF AND MOST OF MY NEIGHBORS THANK YOU TOO!

It is opening in June and it is paid for how can it fail miserably. I will be there on opening day and bike ride the entire length with my family. It will be a joyous occasion for all the families who live around it. Property values around it are up already and gang bangers are moving out faster than you can say "Allen Montgomery"!

America was built on Capitalism. That mean businesses, anything that benefits businesses, benefits the working people that live here. Do not forget, I believe Republicans are not free from evil either. Old man Dayle was corrupt, but he loved Chicago and he made sure the bill were paid. Chicago moved forward with him as Mayor. Not like his son, who took everything including the kitchen sink as he fled! Rahm had no idea what problems he took over from that one! Now we all are paying dearly for it and the worst is still to come.

Charlie, You would have all of the answers to all of your questions if you were to have attended just one of the Humboldt Park Advisory Counsel meetings in the four years that they have been here. RF has had representatives at all the meetings, months prior to each fest. I am surprised that you have never attended one when you care so much about the park. If I am not mistaken, you were informed on another thread that RF was told where to set up by the Park District and had no say in the matter. Most people should have a beef with the Park district and not with RF. Why repeat a question that has already been answered? I think I get the spirit of your blogs. Wasn't you who wrote "OH NO I CANT FIND PARKING THIS CAN NOT STAND!" and "OH NO I CANT USE THE PARK FOR 3 DAYS. I MUST GET THIS FEST SHUT DOWN!" You even called this event "Reckless","This type of festival belongs in Northerly Island away from neighborhoods where small children go to bed at 8pm and there is plenty of parking."? on other blogs? You now write " I don't have a problem with Riot Fest being in Humboldt Park, and I have not called for their removal, I think there is room for all here". Which is it? I have been going to HPAC meetings for over a decade and I agree with what you wrote on this thread. Hope to see you at the next HPAC meeting.

I wonder what would happen to the person who writes the same thing about PR Fest? Think that person would receive the same treatment as you or would they be attacked and labeled like the Tipsy Cake lady? How about this, I will join you on addressing the mud and grass problems associated with RF if you join your neighbors in addressing all the gang problems and shootings that happen around HP during PR Fest? Sounds fair to me.

Governor Rauner will not spend tax payer money that we do not have. That is what Republicans do (Indiana,Wisconsin,New Jersey) but Democrats do not (pensions,parking meters,Meigs Field) . Republicans do many things wrong in my book but their economics almost always makes sure the bills are paid. Something that has not been done in Illinois for decades! Now it's time we pay for who we elected to control our tax money. Ex Mayor Dayle now is a consultant of the law firm that represents the company that purchased the parking meters, I understand. That's a Democrat for you!

Charlie glad to see your comments and I am cleaning up HP. Why don't you join me and your neighbors on April 18 and help do just that! Come pick up garbage with me and show me this mud patch in your picture. I to walk the park almost every day and I saw the park totally different from you. All the muddy trenches were gone and the ground was level. Most of the park is under water and has all the garbage in it from this awful winter, this is not RF's fault! RF already gives residents free tickets and if you pick up a small bag of cigarette butts, you get free tickets. RF does not get everything free like PR Fest (permits,utilities) or big corporate donations so they can not let everyone in for free like they do. You need to show up at the meetings held at the field house and find out all the great things RF does for HP. You can ask questions directly to RF personal. PR fest has never done what RF has in the way of donations and listening to the neighbors in HP. Yes, are are a few that do not like RF, can't please everyone all the time but we all must change with the times. From your questions above, you just need to learn about RF and how HP is better for it being here and not worry about a mud patch so much. I believe you you change your view and join most of your neighbors in support of RF.

Like always, Allen is misleading so many with his half truth comments. The Bloomingdale Trail will be completed, just not with state funds. BECAUSE WE ARE BROKE!!! Only Democrats blame the Republican Governor who was elected only two months ago for funding problems that they themselves created years ago! Please read the Chicago Tribune articular titled "Illinois Democrats and memory loss" and learn the facts of why the funding is not there for all of these great things! The states funding is very small compared to the cost of the entire project. Rahm will get the money from private parities and not the tax payer, which will be another thing to thank Rahm for and Chuy could never do. There are Republicans at fault for our funding problems also but at least we have a Governor who is addressing them now unlike the two prior ones that were absolutely worthless. 
Last note, 95000 people moved out of Illinois in 2014! Illinois took a population loss for the first time in a while. Sounds like Detroit? Keep telling yourselves Rauner is to blame and Democrats had nothing to do with it. Wait until we get our property tax increased next year to pay into city workers pensions that Chicago Democrats have not payed in two decades! Can't blame Republicans for that one!

If it is only you, why use "Humboldt Heights Block Club" and make it seem like you represent a large group that does not exist!

Unless you only want your point of view heard and not those of the neighbors which do not agree with you. Never received a notice of a 3200 Block Clean Up so how could I have attended one?

Illinois is the proof that we are on the wrong path! Tax and spend, raise the minimum wage is exactly what Detroit did. Our schools, libraries and police stations are being closed because the middle class (tax payers) are leaving the state/city! When there are only rich and poor people (both don't pay taxes) living in the city, it falls. By the way Wisconsin and Indiana are benefiting greatly from our stupidity. They are laughing as our businesses and residences move into their states because Republicans paid their bills unlike Illinois Democrats did not! If we do not start acting fiscally responsible like Republicans instead of promising everyone goodies with no way to pay for them like Democrats here do, WE ARE SCREWED.

@chi techie, "hires staff who are being paid more money than the people who did the same jobs under Quinn". Wrong! Rauner hired Republican staff with a pay CUT! That means getting payed less than the same jobs under Quinn. Rauners staff left high paying jobs to save us. The Republicans jumped into these positions because they see it as they civic duty to fix what the Democrats have destroyed in Illinois.

The problem with the pensions are because the Democrats did not fund it for DECADES! Now how do you tell retirees that they have to take a pay cut when the law reads they must be paid what is owed to them for paying into their pension their entire life? No easy fix and we will all feel this in 2015 when the city is forced to pay into the pensions big time to make up for the Dayle theft of our taxes that were to fund city workers retirement!

Paying gang bangers not to gang bang is just stupid. CeaseFire worked in some small locations but in Chicago it was an EPIC FAIL! I witnesses CF first hand in the 014th District, providing gang bangers with cameras and them videoing police arresting fellow gang members. That did not help law abiding citizens at all. Good riddance to bad rubbish and save our tax dollars! Remember, the city and state are BROKE because people voted in the politician who promised them the most goodies with no way to pay for them. Does that sound familiar, "I will get rid of red light cameras-I will hire one thousand more police officers, I will reopen schools"! When asked the hard questions, "where will you get the money?", how will you fill the revenue loss?"!!! Aaaaa..... I will figure it out after you vote me in!

The three of you write you respectfully disagree with me but you are agreeing 90% with me. I never wrote RF is the only reason HP property values are going up! Where did you get I meant that? HP is getting better on it's own, but as Salata wrote "but slower". I was asked to show data, just look around HP and see what is being built! You have to be blind not to see it! Until the last four years only low income projects were being built! Developers would not invest a dime into gang ridden HP with only one fest that attracts gang bangers to come back and take over the neighborhood, creating violent havoc. Gangs have moved out greatly but the perception was they still were the majority of HP. Now here comes RF! They been around for over ten years and they chose HP because studies they did showed the gangs were replaced by their patrons. People who do not live in HP but tell everyone they know how bad gangs are in HP were shocked when nothing happen with gangs at the first RF. NO gangs taking over, NO need for hundreds of police with air support and most of all, NO shootings and violence. Proving that HP has changed for the better and now is the time to invest. That truth is reenforced with every RF at has occurred in HP! HP would still move forward without RF and The Bloomingdale Trail but it would be in first gear compared to over drive that it is in now.

This is my opinion, but not only mine. One reason RF came to HP is because most of the people that go to it live here! HP has a very bad reputation. With every RF that happens and there are no shootings, gangs don't take over the neighborhood and no need for police with air support to stop violence proves to all attendees that it is not the neighborhood that attracts such behavior. Have you noticed all the new home construction as far West as Central Park in HP now that RF is here?

Hi Darryl Holiday, the story did answer the question of RF leaving! It is great to know that RF will be in HP straight from the source. Thank you. What you wrote about the EB threads is what upset me and others. Both threads showed over whelming support for RF in HP but you reported the very opposite. In the thread I started, neighbors wrote about how they wanted to help RF stay in HP and thanked me! Some how you reported this thread " fell short of a definitive answer" as to neighbors wanting RF to stay! The other thread, 40 neighbors comments were in in favor about RF staying in HP and only one was negative. You reported "responses ranging from concern to good riddance"! I understood that to mean 50/50 in responses and zero in support! I repeat "I PREFER DNAinfo." for local news. What you wrote about these threads were not supported by the source. You want to interview supporters of RF in HP? Pick a large location because I think you will be surprised how many of my neighbors will want to talk to you.

This is a fantastic thread! Never would have imagined it would go so long with so many. It is great to read what my neighbors have contributed to it whether people believe it to be right or wrong. I was shocked to read what some people wrote and laughed at others. I have no doubt that HP is a better place to raise a family because of it. Together we can, but, this is the thinking of a former member of the brotherhood of Chicago's finest. LOL!

Check out what law abiding citizens do what they see a police officer under attack! I got a kick of the lady hugging and kissing the officer on the head. Do you think the citizens of Ferguson would do the same? YouTube-"Ordinary citizens rush to help police officer under attack". For every bad cop there are a thousand good ones out protecting us.

Kate Dudenaw, Please go to YouTube, view-"Texas Officer assaulted on traffic stop" and then rethink what you wrote. From witness statements, this is close to what Michael Brown did to the police officer. The offender was unarmed also in this attack. Officers do stupid things also, but more officers are injured just doing their job then like Allen would say "shoot incident people in the back"!

It is the law and the thinking/belief of most law abiding citizens. You do not have to have a weapon to kill some one. You have to be a savage or out of your mind to attack a police officer! What would you have the officer do , beg pretty please stop attempting to kill me? I have fought with a murderer who wanted to kill me! Unless you have been through this, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. That's nuts!

Mike Felder, both threads stated their sources and only one thread had one negative comment. Please reread both. The story belittled RF and trivialized the residence of HP who love it and have witnessed what has happened to HP after RF arrived. To make such statements is like saying an aircraft carrier is just a boat! Reports like this one happen about RF, have you ever seen a articular about the gangs taking over HP during the other fest. I would say very bad reporting and not a non issue at all!

Wise people do not rush to judgement and hear all the facts before making a decision. I never use the word liberal, where did you get I don't like them? A great reporter only reports facts, like in the articular I sent you. He has already commended the CA. officers for shooting the unarmed black homeless man, when video from witnesses shows the man with his hands on a officers gun and you hear the officer shout "he's got my gun" several time. Oops! he wrong again! Liberal or not, he has zero creditably now.

What a shame that the incident police officer was already convicted in the court of public option for doing his job of protecting law abiding citizens and himself! This is where you write "police officers shot incident people in the back"! Micheal Brown was a gang banger and if go on Youtube, you can view videos he has made of Robberies he committed with his gang. One video shows him and another gang banger stomping and robbing an old black male in the hood. Another gang banger who doesn't know of "THE CODE" or values you wrote about!

BM, you wrote "The majority of us are forcibly moved through a process of economic ethnic cleansing Every time we are moved, we get poorer, but every time White people move, the property value goes up. Do you realize that you just wrote " ?!?!? When PR's move out, the property value goes up and where they move into the property value goes down, where whites move in the property values goes up"!!! I know a lot of PR's who would disagree with you in a big way! I believe that proves your logic is the same as Allen, not making any sense! I have plenty of neighbors of color who have learned to get a job, save their money and buy a home here. Proud of earning their piece of the American dream and becoming Americans and not trying to change America into a far away land. You can't stop change.

Buster, "peaceful parading is nice", but that is so short lived and then it turn insane for hours. It always starts out as peaceful parading and when the numbers are so high, that the police can no longer control them, gang bangers come out in force and the crimes start to occur everywhere. It is such a double standard! You know if PR Fest was held up to the same standard, the same powers would be screaming RACISM!!!

A big THANK YOU, Carter O'Brien. That is great information you brought to this thread.
If anyone does not know, I am retired Chicago Police Officer, a male white, worked the street my entire career, several years in HP "back when no one went West of Damen unless they had to". I moved into HP for two reasons, I wanted to raise my family in a diverse community and it was the only up and coming community I could afford. I go to beat meetings and other community meetings but kept hearing gentrification is a problem in HP, I was the problem. The new people moving in are moving the enclaves that live in HP out. A young white male stood at the last big meeting I attended, stated he was a De Paul student, talked about "a study" on how gentrification was destroying HP and that whites are a very small number in HP. I thought, this guy has no idea what is going on in HP and needs to get out of his classroom and onto the streets of HP before talking for HP! I am NOT the problem in HP, and if you were to check out the last census numbers by blocks around the park and not West of Central Park, you will find that Caucasians are the majority in all of them! It takes a lot of hard work for years to buy a home and the home owners in HP are not going anywhere unless they want to cash out big time! Most homeowners are law biding because they have something to loose. Most gang bangers and criminals do not own, so they are the people being forced out. Allen likes thug life "I will never know why", he hates gentrification, "he tells all of us why", and I wanted everyone in HP who reads this thread to think about Allen's words at the next meeting they attend when they are told, "law abiding people moving into HP are the PROBLEM"! EB is great for this discussion because when I talk at meetings about this, a hand full of people usually start screaming and nothing is accomplished! They win, I am not heard.

I don't remember him, but I remember some very bad cops in 014, one was sticking up stores in 013. He is in jail now. Cops can be criminals also, I hate all criminals including cop criminals! There were a lot of gang banger police in 014 back then, most hired with pull from gang banging politicians as I recall. Those days ended when you needed a collage degree to get hired and not just a G.E.D.. No one is perfect, but CPD does it's best.

Okay, now your splitting hairs! If they are in a car and shoot or drive up, get out, and shoot, there is no difference . If you want to watch a drive by that happened not to long ago, go to YouTube, search, 40 shots fired at Beach and Homan. They do the shooting from inside the car and the victim gang bangers run out and shoot from the sidewalk. If this happens once a year, that is one time to many for me. I can prove everything I say is fact or I won't say it. Thankfully no innocent child was killed as they slept when one of those 40 rounds went through a wall in their bedroom.

This is a great thread, I am so proud I started it. We all can learn so much from Allen. He is telling everyone what is going on in his head and what he truly believes. I am surprised that he now sounds like an entirely different person from the other thread and he also added he is alright with white people on this thread! Now for police shooting incident people in the back like he has stated more than a few times on EB. I ask please inform us when did police do this and what became of the officer? None come to my mind, but let's blame that on me being a retired 014th District cop. You wrote " Latino gang structure is based on brotherhood and traditional gang values"! I have never seen that in all my years on the job. I do remember in the news last month reading of the teenage female gang banger who took her teenage brother along to a fight so he could record it on his cell phone over some argument on Facebook. As he recorded the fight between the two gang banging females, a 19 year old Latino male came up from behind him and shot him in the back, killing him. That boy is going to spend the rest of his life in jail, the sister said she will get vengeance and the young boy is just dead. No we see gang life in such a different manner that I will never agree with anything you say about it. You keep writing one thing in one paragraph and the total opposite in the next, make up your mind on what you hate and not. As for drive byes, you must have been out of town the last PR Fest when four were shot in a drive by at Spaulding and Beach and several others occurred in HP during the celebration!

WOW! It is great how you mellowed out on this thread from what you were writing on the other thread, name calling and what EB removed from the thread. I am glad you are now being civil in this conversation.
So much to cover, where to start! First- where did you write " retired affiliated member" and how can you be a retired and a affiliated at the same time? If you now are on the side of law and order, good for you! Why play the race card? You wrote you hate gentrification "code for white" and named races. I am against criminals/gang bangers no matter what their race is. If you are law abiding citizen, I want you as a neighbor no matter what your race is. Having a Polish wife and a half Italian son does not stop you from being a racist or making racist statements. What do you mean by "fully gentrify"? Wicker Park, Buck Town and Logan are not 100% gentrified. They all have low income projects and plenty of CHA rentals spread out all over them. HP has many high density low income projects built only blocks away from each other and some blocks are entirely made up of Bickerdike/Hispanic Housing projects only. Making these areas "for lack of a better term" mini Cabrini Greens. You have a wife, a son, own your own home, an education, a great job and have moved back into HP recently. By definition, you are gentrifying HP or at least helping move low income rentals out! Thanks! Diversity is what is going to make HP a great place to move into and raise a family. Yes, I moved my family here because I was priced out of my Lincoln Park rental and HP was where I could afford to buy and not let that happen again. Did you not do the same? My relatives did not choose to leave, they fled in fear of violence that took over the area, and not because they did not want to live with minorities "blacks"! That was ignorant, you know nothing about my relatives.

UPDATE.....I went to the Humboldt Park Advisory Council meeting Thursday night at 6:30 P.M., Max Wagner a RF coordinator stated "Mike who runs RF has NOT decided if RF will be held in HP"!!!!! From what I understood, RF is being made to jump through hoops to have the fest in HP. I listened as the HPAC President "Amy Vega" told Max that she had sent FOIA requests on funds RF paid to the park district for repairs from last years flood during RF. Another member complained that Sacramento was closed one day prior. There was talk of the food trailers in HP going after RF for lost income because setting up days before RF. Max remarked that Sacramento was only closed for an hour that day, the food trailers have a contract with the park district and have given three options on setting up during RF. This RF did not have to do but reached out to the food trailers to help any way RF could! Max went on that the drains in the park were filled with GREASE, gravel and dirt which contributed to the flooding last year. Amy remarked that clogged drains have been a problem going back as far as 2008 in other locations in the park. Max pointed out clearly that RF has to follow Park District rules and complaints about thous rules being followed belong to the Park District and should be made to them and not placed onto RF.
I do not understand why a fest that does so much good "the list is to long to write here" for HP is being questioned on such minor matters? Shootings and gang activity do not spike during this fest! Why are they getting such a hard time making HP a great place to live by the powers in City Hall? Now is the time citizens of HP! If you love RF, write and call your Alderman, The Mayor and attend Humboldt Park Advisory Council meetings and make your voice be heard! RF needs us to show our overwhelming support.

Yes, former and to this day, up standing member of HP, sorry to read you are not and proud of it. As for gangs leaving, check out Division St. (Kedzie to Homan), gangs all gone, the rest of the streets are next. The neighbors got together and voted the gang banger hang out dry at Division and Spaulding, bye bye! The one and only shooting in years ended with two savages going to jail for the rest of their lives after killing a member of their own gang. Guess they didn't know about your code for banging. I do agree with you, back then most in the hood were criminals but now the good citizens are in the majority and you will be only a bad memory soon enough. Did I ever arrest you? I have locked up so many bangers in HP, anything is possible or at least some of your friends. This is not the thread for this conversation so until another is started about ridding HP of gang banging savages, this will be my last comment on the matter. Sorry to think your best days are behind you now, bye bye.

No other fest in HP does what RF does for HP. There are things that need improving and will be as time goes by. Also, no shootings, gang banging or need for an army of police with air support to keep the peace. All the businesses around HP stay open and make big money from sales to the visitors brought into our neighborhood. I would say the minor problems with RF are almost not worth mentioning. I can not wait for this years fest!

Talked to many CPD officers who handled jobs there and all say it is a hole. Why is it hard to close? The owners keeping changing (probably only the names) and rent it out to the club set (Rappers,DJ's,rave and parties only announced on social media) who could never get a permit, insurance and vanish after a shooting. Remember club KA BOOM (Chicago/Halsted)? They had the same gang banger party day until the all night fight and shots fired into the morning that got they license pulled. Only the owner of this building probably never needs to get the licenses because it is on who rents the space to do so. This building needs fast track demolition to solve the problems with it I think.

Gang banging is good before the undesirables came along, police shoot innocent people in the back, am I getting this right?!?!

Don't listen to the nay sayers, most don't even live here! If you can buy a 3-4 unit there and live in it, you are going to make huge dollars on your investment when the Bloomingdale Trail is finished. Only you know what you can put up with and things get kind of crazy around HP during the fest that happens in June. If you can put up with that weekend of garbage and some gang violence that is happening less and less with every year that goes by, welcome to HP. I have raised my family here and it is night and day from what it was like when I moved in over a decade age.

If they knew how Brickerdike was killing HP with the flood of low income housing like this building, they would not be giving them an award!

When do we have enough of this and the rest of the city can share this burden? I read two more low income projects are being built just blocks away, one along the Bloomingdale Trail on land that could made big tax money for the neighborhood.

Now the hating dibers will damage the vehicle or just stroke out as they look out a window at the evil person who needed to park on the public street.

Now you think you have the right to keep that spot as your own and screw all your neighbors because others do to???? I do feel bad for your neighbors. 
I am glad my block does not look like a trash dump and some of my neighbors now clear spaces without dibs. You have to make the example for people to do the right thing.

Freedom is not free. A criminal smiles every time they hear another way to arrest them has been taken away from the police because someone said (We give up freedoms piece by piece for "our own protection").
I wish these check points were happening every week in front of my house until the criminals moved away. Then my block would be as safe as where the check points are happening now!
Police can not stop you for only a safety belt violation and that is why these check points were developed. There are a lot of laws to follow to set up these check points. Most here would be surprised to find out how many hoops the police must jump thru before doing one.
The only thing about them that drives me insane is that they are placed where most drivers follow the law and can pay the ticket. They were supposed to be placed in high crime areas where criminals drive and can be arrested. That would make crime ridden areas safe but would cost the city money instead of making revenue. These check points are also a way to force officers to write tickets they probably don't on their own.

Passengers of vehicles must obey the law also, not just the driver.
Now let's think what the officer is going through, the officers are there to right safety belt tickets, not give breaks! Everyone has a story about why they were breaking the law and not be given a ticket. Some people believe officers MUST listen to their stories and that they should be excused for breaking the law. How about telling the officer, you are sorry for breaking the law, that you deserved the ticket and see how the officer reacts to your honesty.

Neighbor told me his dog went off around 2 A.M. but when he looked into the alley he saw a truck with a trailer speeding away.

This has been talked about at park meetings and they do nothing. Many have complained about the city's needle exchange van that would stop in the park continuously and finally, it has not been seen in awhile. Now the Midnight Ministries (at Division/California) and another group that hands out fruit/veg's (at North/Francisco) have been notified about the dangerous conditions they are making in the park. It is fantastic that they help people who need it but the crowd that they bring into the park contains IV drug users and they leave needles at almost every gathering. The park is for women and children to play, not the location to meet up with groups that have drug addiction problems! Both organizations have been notified and unfortunately it looks like it will take a child or a mother to be stuck by one of these needles and sue them to stop this unbelievable dangerous practice! Good luck with your efforts. We would not need sharps containers if there were no needles in the park.

The biggest worry amongst Chicago Politicians is an intelligent and informed voter. Anyone associated with this man or this group for the racist views they obviously have should not be in a place of power in this city.
HP will never be of one race but is becoming a location where ALL can live together in what appears to be Chicago's first diverse community. I moved here in part so my children would be raised in such a community and now my Grand Children also. I consider myself extremely lucky to be a part of bring HP back to life.

Elizabeth K., so glad to read you were not injured and thanks for the heads up. On the bright side, less than a decade ago this was common place and shootings were an every day fact of HP but now life is coming back big time and very fast. The incident you had is becoming less and less with every gang banger and criminal that moves out and soon it will be history. I love the way things are changing in HP!

That area is already flooded with low income housing so why three and six flats in just a few blocks from one another? The affordable housing units around there are not even fully occupied so why build more. The people that live there vote and I heard them say "proco joe has gotta go"!

This is not scattered and it will not help the property owners in the neighborhood. This looks like a wall to stop the negative realities of gentrification. Here comes The Bloomingdale Trail and LUCHA will grab the best land before gentrification gets it and ruins the neighborhood! Check all the low income housing there already and "they" say the neighborhood needs more!!!! South of the trail at Kedzie, they took the land away from a town home builder and built low income ones and now they want the north side of the trail to! This is to much! Six unit buildings is NOT what HP needs at all! People who live in this area should go to the meeting at 6 P.M. this Tuesday at "Envision Unlimited" at 1801 N.

From what you wrote about the poor man in the wheel chair and his daughter, you did nothing but wished to be able to take a picture! I would have helped them instead of blaming fest organizers for getting them stuck in the mud. Try more helping and less complaining, I know I am better for doing so.

First- Why do individuals write "you talk bad about PR Fest and want to shut it down'? No one on this thread wrote shut down PR Fest! So stop the hating!
Second- to the comment " And we all should be offended by your comments. U have know idea what is good for any child!!!!!" and like your the leading expert on raising children and you know me. My reply-PLEASEEEEEEEE!!!!! Enough said!
Third- I watched the crowd leave at Division and Kedzie, from 9:30 to 11:30 P.M.. I witnessed people of every race, creed and culture acting civilized, laughing and responded positivity when I greeted them. NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WANT SO EVER!
Only a few stragglers after 11:30 P.M. so I went to sleep with no beeping cars or screaming gang bangers on top of vehicles to keep me awake. This fest is a great example on how to act when leaving the neighborhood that welcomed them.
Last- only to be the devils advocate, medical marijuana and liquor are legal so I guess that's why people were using them and you can't say they are bad for doing so.
The children of HP benefit from RF because visitors see HP as a great park, invest in the area and raise the standard of living here. Where before everyone rated HP from what they get from the news and were mistaken that this area is a violent one and to stay away.

Why would anyone ask for money to run if they have not proclaimed that they are? More questions come up than answers and that does not seem correct.

@Humboldt Park Guy, many have brought up just what you are writing about (CAL/DIV) at the Humboldt Park Advisory Comity meetings. Midnight Ministries uses that corner as a meeting place to help the homeless which causes them to take up residence there. We even talked to a representative from the ministries and pointed out what dangers they are placing women and children who come to the play in the park in.(ie, HIV infected needles, broken bottles and using every tree and bush as a bathroom). They now bring garbage cans with them but would not move. We pointed out church parking lots both East of that location and now the church for the hurting at Homan/Division could be used where children are not put at risk but they replied this is were they live. I guess it will take a child to be infected by a needle before they move. Good luck to you sir.

The milk crates and plastic crates are picked up (four days later) but the broken tables are still at California and Le Moyne. If you check out where all the tents where set up, you will notice all the damage from wood chips and cardboard used to keep their feet dry and still there. Riot Fest did cause damage due to the rain but they paid the high price to repair the lawns and you see no damage now. Years have gone by and the wood chips and the damage to the lawns from the tents set up for a month straight just get worse with every Annual Puerto Rican Day and Festival and never have been repaired. Maybe the Puerto Rican Day and Festival should be held up to the high standards as Riot Fest! @RubyRed above is your answer, DNA INFO. seems to be the only news that is willing to tell the truth about this fest and what happens to the good people that live in HP.

OK, then give me the same respect. I never said the two locations are the ONLY nice places. "Do you not think that listing North & California as vibrant places and labeling Division as an eyesore (except for a bar & grill!) has no racial implications? Did you notice the flags?" Only you used "eyesore"! I know a lot of words are being placed in my mouth and saying I use codes for WHITE= (RACISM) is 'utterly disgusting' to me! The other statement "that meth reunion known as Riot Fest" shows that person for what they are. Why even bring Riot Fest into this thread but to take the spot light off the problems on this strip. I also agree, there are many our stores here doing well and good for the neighborhood, I was only thinking of places to go to for a night out in HP and did not think of the other stores. I stand corrected.

Last quick point, the owner of Division Street Bar and Grill is Puerto Rican I understand and the pizza place is Mexican or at least Latin. So code for white must be in the eye of the racist! I think this is why "Did you notice the flags?" steers businesses away from that strip. If you welcome everyone and anyone instead of telling all this location between the flags is only for Puerto Ricans, all other keep out, I bet businesses would thrive.

LOL!!! Where do they come up with this stuff??? I wrote what I feel about those locations as for the others, I have been taught if you have nothing nice to say about something, you say nothing. I said nothing. Let me be the first to agree with you Matt M2, utterly disgusting is what I call it also.
By the way, COCO'S is closed so why would I mention a place that went out of business as a shining light on division?

This was discussed in a thread around a month ago that I started, please review.

I believe the pizza place and Division Street Bar and Grill are the only shinning lights between Western and California.

Welcome to HP. It saddens me when I read " I'm new to the neighborhood - still learning the difference." Gun shots from fireworks that is. That means the person came from a neighborhood where gun shots are extremely rare if ever heard, that is sweet and I hope will be HP soon. You will learn what gun shots sound like in the next 20 days for sure. Puerto Rican fest is around the corner and we already had a female shot on the 1400 block of North Homan and my wife and I were awaken by a drive by shooting at Division and Kedzie at 3 A.M. this morning. Friday the 30th. I still wish this violence spike before the fest will stop at the next one but it has not happened yet. Thankfully it becomes very peaceful after so this to will pass.

Anonomous1108 YES, Great conversation going on here. Thanks for your support and I will always answer a civil question (the difference between a troll and a true EBer). No I would not work for minimum wage but I have an education that will get me more and I will not become homeless if I did not have an income. Last, this is action, talking to all concerned starts the ball rolling. I would rather see it get more welcoming to businesses in Chicago. This would ease the problem of pay with jobs, I believe. VOTE!!!!! We must see through BS politicians say and vote for people who care about the city and what is best for it even if it is not PC. POINT- the lot where a Chick-fil-A was to be built is still vacant! One Alderman screaming RACISM (almost always wrong but a great attention getter) stopped jobs building it, working in it and all the benefits of the tax revenues for what? That same Alderman with another held a demonstration against the owner of Tippsey Cake Bakery when she talked about gun violence hurting her business in Humboldt Park. They got press and we loose a business and still have to deal with the violence! EVERYONE can do something to solve these problems, VOTE and remember what these morons in City Hall are doing to us!

Where shall I begin?First, no one is QUITTING AND BECOMING HOMELESS. Second, only Daley gave everyone who voted his way a city job, even if it was a ghost payroll. As for slave wages....pleaseeeeee. Now let's look at the facts, Then Mayor Daley vetoed the big box tax because he knew it would destroy the city even though every Alderman voted for it and only cared about votes and not the city! Stop and look, Capitalism is powered by competition, if you noticed MD's does not have much. How many Culvers, Red Robin, Sonic and my favorite Texas Road House restaurants (to many to name all the rest) have very little to no locations in Chicago? Could anyone imagine what their employees wages would be if they hired against each other? But they are nowhere to be found because they learned the government here could force them to pay $15 and hour and they are not stupid. All those jobs we could have here in the city, but no because of politics like this. We do not need more politics, we need more jobs to cure this problem. @ anonomous1108, Do you remember when there were five people working on each garbage truck? Now because of unions, it is down to three and the blue garbage can pick up is only one! I believe people would gladly work a garbage truck for minimum wage and no benefits if they knew they could work their up the ladder. I would much rather have a hundred people working and still need some help from the government than ten people doing the same job for huge $$$ while ninety people live on welfare. Last, one of my sons lost his job and now he back home with mom and dad, not homeless. If you did not save for a rainy day and did not even put four percent of your income into some type plan (like all most everyone in America failed to do), well good time Charley that is to bad so sad. I wish my son could get a starter job at MD's.

MD's is a stepping stone to a future job that will support a person/family. If you make MD's a life long job it is not their job to support your life style. Get an education and then a good paying job and stop telling others to support your poor decisions. I was a paper boy, then stock boy and never thought those jobs were a career. I am now retired and the city is going broke and I may loose my pension, a lot of people making bad decisions! I might have to go back to work and I will take your MD's job.

The way I understand it- Area used, Division to North / Humboldt Blvd to Kedzie. Several Stages everywhere in the area. This RF will be the largest ever because I believe it is their 10th anniversary. As for traffic problems- you must plan ahead, large numbers of people will be leaving at closing but this has cleared up quickly at the last two events. This is due to no one hanging around or driving in circles with gang members on top of their vehicles displaying gang signs. There as been no gang fights with people from RF using flags to beat on one another or throwing bricks and bottles in the middle of the streets so again why think this is worst than the traffic during PR Fest? There is no comparison of these two fests, IMO.

So do I! Is everyone ready for this one.....I was at the Humboldt Park advisory committee last night and there was little to no discussion about safety during PR Fest, but the subject was changed very quickly to Riot Fest. One person stated she was scared about Riot Fest because a drunk got into her car, drank her perfume and passed out. Another stated that different bands would attract groups that would not get along and cause problems. Very big concerns about security!
This will be the third Riot Fest in HP and the largest one yet. The last two had NO CALLS for police! Huge groups enjoyed many alcohol tents in peace. No violent crimes in the area, gangs on top of cars beeping horns and screaming till all hours or setting vehicles on fire as with the last PR Fest! Why even talk about Riot Fest when the powers that run PR Fest will not even attend HPAC meetings to address the neighbors concerns like Riot Fest promoters will and have done every time!

Most people just listened to the meeting and a few, talked the most were way out there. One man said he was not happy that he could no longer see the Blue Angles from his back yard because of a tall building near by.

It is not just the mural but want happened to Americans when they started building on the vacant lot and NO ONE CARED about the mural. You think in America you get a permit to build and invest in Humboldt Park but then the powers that be find out your not Puerto Rican, especially in THEIR neighborhood and the next thing you know, the city is taking your property away! This happened a lot back then and new buildings are still screened today. HP needs tax paying buildings not tax exempt low income projects but builders are told to have meetings and jump through hoops before they can build!!!! Check out all about this mural, it is more about keeping non-Puerto Ricans out then back stabbing history of a few terrorists.
@Marcy, it sounds like you have been warned about the mural and not so much welcomed.

Now to get back to the thread, 400K per unit reasonable, PLEASEEEEEEE....
Two luxury single family green homes on the park, 1210 and 1212 N Kedzie Ave. sold for under 390K. Four bedrooms, three baths, back yard with a garage, now please explain how five stories of two bedroom one bath low income apartments cost more per unit? The numbers do not lie. You can check the prices the luxury homes through any realtor and ask any private builder what they would charge to build those projects and you would see how much of tax payer dollars are vanishing into someones pockets. How about building more luxury homes and sell them to families in need instead of lining the pockets of the corrupt politicians and their kick back friends?

I just took a walk around the neighborhood and noticed several apartment buildings with around 20 units a building, gutted and being rehabbed. These buildings use to be mainly filled with Puerto Ricans but now they are empty. A 23 unit building across the street from me was almost all Latino and some African American and many were gang bangers. The building has been gutted, rehabbed and now there is only a couple of Puerto Ricans living there and I understand most of them are moving out this year.

Yes, I do. It is gone, OUT OF BUSINESS! Signs in the windows say, opening April 25 is AY ! Mami, Puerto Rican cuisine. I don't think it will last as long as Coco's and will have the same fate as almost all the privately owned businesses on the Paseo. I just walked down Division St. and on that one block alone several businesses have gone belly up or have changed hands because the prior owner could not make it work. I believed Coco's would have been the exception to the rule on the Paseo Boricua but this now sadly proves even Puerto Rican Cuisine shops can not survive there. If I am not mistaken, there is only one restaurant that has the same owner and all others have failed or flipped over the last decade. This also is proof that government should not dictate where people of one ethnic back ground should live and tell others other to stay out. Diversity is what is bring Humboldt Park back to life and would probable do the same for the Paseo.

The trail ends at Ashland Ave. where Metra, buses and cabs can be found with ease. A trail along the river to down town and most other trails is in the works and this means a totally vehicle free path through most of Chicago. No need for that vehicle any longer in Chicago. I am looking forward to that day.

As reported in the news as happening in HUMBOLDT PARK, but it DID NOT HAPPEN IN HUMBOLDT PARK!!!!!

That location is in an area known as WEST HUMBOLDT PARK!

We must stop these violent crimes from being reported as happening in HP when they occur over a mile away if we want people to know that HP is much safer than the news reports!

On a positive note, I have found that the area West of Kedzie Ave. on Chicago Ave. are already calling their neighborhood West Humboldt Park. They have organized and with help from the city, cleaned up Chicago Ave. with huge improvements. I have be told, there are large indicators/art signs stating Welcome to West Humboldt Park on Chicago Ave.. I am happy to hear at another group has already started to take pride in their neighborhood which is not in the park.
This is a step in the right direction, now let's keep the ball rolling in making Chicago a better place to live and place the park into HP.

This is a fantastic response to my proposal, and I want to thank everyone. There are a few thou that refuse to get it, and I am sorry for them. Individuals that spew hate, lies and drop the race card like a lead brick. I can't believe who wrote I was not working under the true light of Everyblocks, LOL!!!! It appears to be only a few name callers to the many helpful responses on this thread and I again thank the good people on Everyblocks.
From what I understand, it is the neighborhood boundaries of HP which is the goal to have better defined. They change at will and when violence happens a mile West the news reports that it happen in HP and the park gets another black eye.
This has NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE, and is only about how crime is reported. I laugh at the closed minds that try to label me a racist and other names which I have no idea what they mean. This will make life better for all who live around the park no matter what race, religion or sexual preference my neighbors are, we all want to live in peace. It starts with taking pride in our neighborhood and yes, getting upset when haters (who don't even live here) exaggerate the evil that happens and never acknowledges all the great things happens everyday in HP.
After the park, it is diversity that makes HP a wonderful place to raise a family now. This will never change. Look at Wicker Park, Smith Park and Buck Town, none of them are 97% white and only whites made them into what they are today. HP can be even better with a more even mix of people of every kind and orientation. I know my neighbors and they are not going anywhere and we have worked together and made great strides in making HP safe for all who live here.
Only the criminals are leaving HP and I am happy to show them the door and give them the boot as the neighborhoods help in bring back HP's good name.

KJ "This doesn't work for Humboldt Park because with the other examples: West UK Village, West Bucktown, those are already good neighborhoods." Those good neighborhoods are not on any city map. The idea is not to raise property values but to stop reporting crime that happens on the far West side as being committed in the park. Humboldt is a beautiful neighborhood. Unfortunately it also has a lot of crime reported that has never happen here.

Sarah it is the City Halls definition of what the boundaries of HP. When violence occurs at at the intersection of Cicero Ave. and Kinzie Ave. the news reports it to have happened in Humboldt Park. Many think this violence has happen inside the park itself when it occurred over a mile West of the park. This is the major reason people give HP such a bad reputation. HP use to be horrible with gang bangers controlling every block not to many years ago, I know, I have lived here for over a decade. From then till now is night and day and it is getting so much better so quickly that even I can't believe my own eyes. The last few years, it has been like the gangs were never here.
KJ to the West it is Cicero Ave., not Pulaski Ave., a WORLD of difference.
Salata I never said anything about Logan Square and when realtors show properties east of California Ave. South of Division St. they call it West Ukrainian Village and North of Division St., West Buck Town. I think you are very funny too. I have no doubt that they do this because of bad press about HP. 
Smith Parker everyone should know the area of Smith Park and how well the neighbors have worked together to make that park a fantastic one. The last thing I would want to do is step on the great work everyone has done in that area. In fact we would ask for your support to help clean up HP, the area North of Chicago Ave. which would only make Smith Park an even better place to raise a family. Again, I can only hope we are as successful in HP as Smith Park residents are today.

Apple Jaxx, this is the first and last time I will respond to your unneighborly view on where I live and raise my family (you have to live here to know what it is like). You and others that repeat false information of how bad it is in HP for no reason but to scare good people from moving in and making HP a better place to live. Haters can not change the fact that the area around the park in NOTHING like it was only a few years ago!
Now as for the numbers, Humboldt Park has boundaries that go as far West as Cicero Ave. and as far South as Kinzie St.. If you go to that intersection, you will find it has as much in common with HP as Englewood does. Crime that happens there is not what is happening in HP as you portray with your reported crime numbers. The Machete Wielding video taping thugs were in West Town to be exact just to let you know, (you would if you lived here).
As for the loved one you talk about and have before on other threads, all this violent crime happening to her and she does not move away, WHY? She seems to be at ALL the wrong locations at the wrong time and has not learned to avoid criminals. From what you say, she a crime magnet, luck to still be alive. I have learned that in HP (as everywhere else probably), bad things happen to bad people. There are shootings and people (for lack of a better term) get shot. All most all of the time, it is one gang banger shooting another at two in the morning. Enough said about that.
This is why I enjoyed Nextdoor over Everyblock and never read any of these posts on that site. You have to be from the neighborhood or next to it and most of all, you MUST identify your self and your residence.That keeps the trolls away and benifits the community by helping real neighbors work together to clean up the area they live in.

As I recall that individual stated that HP is not home and after being as neighborly then as now was pulled from many a thread. As for HP, please listen to caring residents who work hard to make this a great park and a place to raise a family like I have. This is Chicago and nowhere is it perfectly SAFE! For decades HP has been crime central and politicians worked hand in hand with gang bangers to keep it that way. NOT NO MORE! The Bloomingdale Trail is coming and the bangers are leaving. The last banger will move out soon like all their other criminal friends already have. I own my home here and the value has doubled in the last few years. Many of the buildings that use to house dozens of gang bangers are being rehabbed and poof no more gang bangers. The Alderman and a church leader have built mansions near The Bloomingdale Trail and smart investors know what that means. Property values are going through the roof and I have no buyer regret. I tell all my friends to buy now before the prices are as high as Division and Damen, which they will be soon. Again, I and many others who live here will welcome you if you move in.

The correct police term is Aggravated Assault because the victim was not hit with the weapon and Battery because the victim was punched and injured. If the victim believes he was targeted because of his race (no mater what race) this is a Hate Crime whether or not anyone else thinks it is BS!
I don't understand the comment, the victim was a white person and it was not labeled a Hate Crime so why say when this happens it is any ways called that? Also why bring up this "BS" when we should be working together to get MACHETE WIELDING criminals that video tape their violent acts off our streets and out of Humboldt Park!

I have been to several HPAC (Humboldt Park Advisory Council) meetings at the field house and made the suggestion to make a dog park for this growing problem. I have been told people from the community would have to organize a committee and raise funds and also be willing to maintain the park before the city would consider building one.

Please, every one, come to 1422's beat meeting and meet your neighbors working hard to make this neighborhood safe in every way for every one.
I have two dogs so lame that if I was to leash them, they can barely walk, so not so easy. There is an exception to every law and calling 311 or 911 or the Alderman over a unleashed dog that has not harmed any one is heavy handed in my book.
We do not have enough police to respond to gang-bangers shooting guns calls, what response do you really think you will get when you call in the unleashed dog. By the time 311 answers the dog would be long gone and animal control would probably will not be working. So good luck with that.

I am so glad that soon everyone will be screaming to call the police for the most dangerous problem in Humboldt Park (the unleashed dog).
I want to also point out I walk my dogs unleashed at times but not when anyone else is around and all dogs should be on a leash because it is the LAW. I will unleash less.

Let me get this straight, big dog off leash, walks by other people, listens to owner and has not made any bad actions. Other dog scared, people in car (no way to be harmed) scared, owner might do bad things if asked to put dog on leash (which is the law) and call police and alderman to handle the situation! I have read every direction to go in but JUST TALK TO THE OWNER.
I know of only one person who owns a Mastiff on the 3200 West block of Potomac and he is a nice guy. Yes his dog barks at people while behind his fence like every dog should. This gentleman is a community leader and has helped to make the area safe for everyone. If he is the owner of this dog, you would know him from the beat meetings for beat 1422 (this beat, and where you should go first to get neighborhood problems handled). That is if you went. I am surprised no one here suggested that or attended 1422's beat meeting like I do every other month now.
I will talk the the Mastiff owner I know and I know the problem will be handled, if he is the owner. If not, please join me and other neighbors working together to clean up Humboldt Park rather than calling police or the Alderman on matters that are not life threatening.

Last, There is no real history or movement over this mural, it was most likely placed on this wall to stop gang-bangers from tagging it with their gang signs which covered almost every empty wall back then when this neighborhood was a sewer.

I read the article, here is a quote "Intervening in 2004, the city condemned the property. It will sell the parcel appraised at $353,000 to the network for $1.
The city used tax-increment financing to pay for condemnation of the parcel and has returned $325,000 to the TIF through open-space impact fees. The fees are collected from developers of new residential units and can be used for public open space, Planning Department spokesman Peter Scales said last week.
Aside from the land discount, the city also will cover $50,000 of the estimated $67,000 landscaping cost for the park. The project will add trees, benches and a wooden shelter around the mural, Scales said."
Now $478,000 and $50,000 of badly needed tax dollars were use to kill a tax paying building from being finished at this location, then given to N.N.N.N. for a dollar! Politicians that did this should be not re-elected just for this waste of funds.
Now for some truth, N.N.N.N. has not held a meeting in years after loosing government funding (pretty much history now) and has NEVER represented the residents of Humboldt Park! I know because I use to go to the meetings and was one of only two citizens from HP not on a government payroll. At these meetings, we were told by it's leader, what is good for the neighborhood and shouted down when questions were raised against agenda items like this mural. Almost NO input came from the people who lived in HP and many true residents stopped going because they were made to feel UNWELCOME!
Many of my neighbors with Puerto Rican heritage do not want to be remembered for this embracing act of treason. A very well known resident, proud of her Puerto Rican heritage, started a movement against it by the way.

REALMCCOY, it happened around ten years ago. The developer was going to build a condo building like the low income building now on that location. The land was vacant after a gas station closed because it could not make it there. The government powers of the time wanted no part of home ownership and to prove a point to any other private developers who thought to build tax paying buildings on Division St. what could happen to their building permits.
The vacant lot across the street was a KFC that also could not make it on Division St.. The vacant lot was to become a drive thru Bank O Popular until they closed their bank on Division St. because they could not make it on the street, notice a pattern emerging here? It appears to be the major reason most of the street is vacant and no developers are willing to build up the street.

I have heard that the information about the buildings is being kept from the community but I do understand why a developer would not request community input. I was pointed out that the developer on the Southeast corner of California and Division had his condo permits revoked by the alderman at the time and the city forced them to sell to the city for over a million dollars. The property was then sold to Bickerdike for a dollar and the low income La Estancia "The Stand" project was built lowering the areas tax base. This could be why the buildings were vacant for such a long time and no one would want to buy in that area. I do not believe the government is still telling people where can and can not live in this day and age!

The vacant land on the south side of Grand Ave. between Western Ave. and Rockwell St. would be a perfect location and very appreciated.

I live across the street and there are no problems here now and no reason to be scared. Criminals know this area is under surveillance. This store and the one further west on Division are why the area was voted DRY by the neighbors which relates to NO LIQUOR to all interested in the two! If the Under Contract falls thru it's probably due to the buyer finding this out, "the seller will not notify a buyer of this sale killer". I personally have my fingers crossed for a Star Bucks or a Seven Eleven due to the fact that the area has changed so much for the better. This is a big money corner from all the new people that have moved in recently!

Let me point out some facts to support my statements of how nice it is here in HP and how neighbors got together to make it this way. We had a ghetto liquor store at Division and Spaulding that had gang bangers hanging out 24/7. On our own, we all voted the area dry and poof the gang problem was gone, all on that block will agree with me. Buildings that use to house gang members have been foreclosed on, gutted and rehabbed, poof gone. The No Se Vende crowd and keep the boriqua culture in HP is all but history, to say HP is for one group only and everyone else keep out is insane. You can not stop progress and it is happening here. Yes in the 60's to the 90's, the only thing fished out of the HP lake were stolen cars and body parts. Now the lake is stocked with fish several times a year and Riot Fest brings in thousands from all over the world to enjoy music in the reborn park. The same reason the crime left Wicker Park, Buck Town and Logan Square, is in full swing in Humboldt Park. If you move in I bet more gang bangers will be gone....POOF!!!! If you want to see for your self, come to the grand opening of Humboldt Haus (what was a ghetto liquor store until rehabbed) and we will talk about it over any of the 26 micro brews on tap there. I am sure some one who has moved away from here years ago is going to disagree with this post too.

It is unbelievable how crime has gone down as gang bangers move away and people who care for the neighborhood move in and so close to The Bloomingdale Trail which is making the change happen at light speed! I am happy I purchased my place and think you will too.

No one lobbied for another name, the city stated this is the name from now on, like it or not! The politicians must think we are soft that the word Bloomingdale is to long, hard to spell or people from outside of America would confuse the trail with a store or town. Yes, name it a number and it will be more warm, inviting and unique to Chicago. The citizens were kicked out of the decision and will not swallow the garbage that the city spin doctors say about the name The Bloomingdale Trail.

Smith Parker if you are correct, it was a terrible loss. When anyone posts pictures of themselves making gang signs with their hands and gang signs on their arms with even a marker, I can see how someone can mistakenly identify them as a punk gang banger. Are you saying his older brother is a gang banger and the shooters were attempting to kill him instead? If so, I do not know how the family could live with that! Do you think big brother and the gang he is in will retaliate? Should the neighbors be scared that the punk gang bangers will shoot up the place again because the missed the intended target? There is no easy answer but I do not think helping parents of gang bangers is one of them.

— On the neighbor message Attempted Robbery on Potomac Ave

The Supreme Court has ruled against the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago about abusing tax payers civil rights and every law abiding citizen can legally carry a gun now just like me. Watch the crime rate drop when the city makes carry concealed laws in the next few weeks! All members of my family have their F.O.I.D. cards and can't not wait to see the city's laws on concealed carry. My family will be lucky when law abiding neighbors get training and permits to carry. I wish we had enough police officers on the street so it would not come to this but it will be years before the city can hire such a large number.
I am sorry every time I hear someone has been murdered. It is wrong for a teenager or anyone to be shot on their front porch but when they gang bang or even hang out with gang bangers they must understands it happens. No one said they were worried about the law abiding neighbors who had bullets crash through their front windows and could have been killed because this of who was sitting on the porch next door! I did not read about people asking for donations to replace their windows or assist them if they want to move any from gang bangers. As a punk gang banger walks down a street, everyone around the punk gang banger is endanger of being shot as some other punk gang banger might think this is the time to shot and kill them! How can we stop gang violence if people run to give aide to punk gang bangers and their parents? Can you answer that question r a?

WRONG! I heard the attempt robbery as it happened, but by the time I entered the ally everyone was leaving the scene. The victim was hit on the head with a handgun and it went off but he was not shot. Police arrived on the scene with in a seconds. The offender was later taken into custody and another punk gang banger is out of our neighborhood. I just hope a bunch of my neighbors don't start cooking the punk gang bangers parents dinners and say he is only a child. The victim was NOT buy drugs! This is the second shooting I have witnessed on that block in a month and I am glad this time I helped an innocent victim and assisted in having a punk gang banger removed from the neighborhood. ARE YOU READING THIS PUNK GANG BANGERS?!?! Yes I call the police and I identify criminals and send them to jail! Punk gang bangers do not scare me, but they should be scared me!

If this was a innocent child like people first reported, I would be running to help the family, but this is not the fact. Why to people need to make false statements about this gang member? I am not pushing this and I do not see how we can fight gangs by paying for their funeral expenses and making dinner for their parents after their gang banging children have been killed. If your child got shot by this kid would you diminish the shooters value as a human being. A few days ago, my son and I witnessed a drive by and my son could have been killed by a gang banger with a gun. I do not think it would be helpful if anyone made dinner for the parents of the gang members involved in almost getting my son shot.

If we want to stop the violence, we must stop say these killers are just misunderstood people. We have laws and cage them to protect our children from their actions. When someone say they are people (like you or I), it sounds like we can sit down and talk to them and show them the evil that they do and they will listen to reason and stop. I have been to meetings where it was stated these criminals are someones mother, farther, sister, brother, aunt or uncle and we should take that into consideration. I find that kind of thinking really unhelpful. I actually felt sick. If I had a relative that shoots at children at a drop of a hat, I would do everything in my power to have them put away and not be proud of the fact my relative kills in the name of some gang. My son and I were on Spaulding in the morning two days ago as a drive by shooting was going on, and I know the gang banger could have killed my son and is not what people say I should call him.

Sorry about not being more accurate on the time. This occurred around 11:15 A.M. on 02 Jan 2013. I was caught off guard by it being so early in the morning, for a shooting that is. Neighbors told me that at least one of the vehicles was a Latin King and I have heard from more than one source that they are in fighting and killing their own members for some unknown reason. I don't care if they wipe each other out as long as no one is hurt in the cross fire! My son told me later he was mad at himself for not taking cover after he saw me hit the ground. I told him that because he lives in a good neighborhood and this is not a natural occurrence,and that is why he didn't. I glad my son has not seen or gone through what I have in HP and I am sorry he saw this. I now will double my efforts to clean this scum from my neighborhood. Bangers look out for me!

You have to know the law in great detail to understand. DUI road blocks are set up in all areas of the city from the high income to the ghetto and have to room to operate with officer safety in mind. Drivers are stopped by a certain given number (like every fifth vehicle) or if an officer notices law breaking (open alcohol-out headlight). No one is loosing their freedom from this and if you believe a driver is stopped at a road block because they are a young person of color, there is nothing I can say to enlighten you or get you to understand the truth. I think it best I stop there on that subject! Think! It use to be thousands of DUI related deaths a year and now that number is way down due to these road blocks. I believe I can say the people prefer being alive to this extremely small inconvenience. Another note, if officers set up by a bar and stop drivers who the officers observed leave that bar, that is called entrapment by law.

There is a hole lot of red tape when picking a location for a DUI road block. The locations have been picked out and checked by the CPD law department and have not changed much in years.

What would you have her do to please you if anything she would have done would have been correct in your view? I again would be happy just to see as many officers as you do around me making it safe for people in my neighborhood.

It is not our job to investigate everyone doing anything in our neighborhood and notifications of this mega-church were not released until after the neighborhood had no way of stopping it! It was the job of the mega-church to notify our neighborhood in every way possible of they intent to change our neighborhood and if the neighborhood would welcome or needed the change. Last note, unless someone can prove that the 4000 that will invade the area are from this area, I believe it is without question that they are not my neighbors! This was an Epic Fall on part of our Alderman for not notifying us and helping this mega-church.

I am glad to read all of the constructive comments with only one rant that can easily be ignored. The title of this thread-Officer in car for hours doing NOTHING, was an inflammatory one and wrong if it was unknown what the officers were doing! There are so many things an officer might have been DOING there legitimately the list is to long to write here. Donger was correct in questioning what the officers were doing, and I am so surprised to read how many people realize they were probably just doing their job and what it could have been. Now this was only my opinion and still enjoy reading what Donger or anyone else has on their mind. I read the rest of Dongers comments and can only reply to him-Thank-you.

Sorry to hear this, I live right around the corner. More bad news, it was probably one of your neighbors. My daughter was burglarized across the street for me. A couple who just moved in the same building, watched my daughter remove both of her dogs to take them to the vet. When she got back a short time later, her front door was forced open an all of her electronics were taken. Now keeping watch, about a week later we observed to same couple let in several men into the main entrance and were shocked to see them enter a vacant condo below my daughters and start removing all of the appliances to a waiting u-haul van. Police where called, subjects arrested, items returned, but the couple was not arrested because they did not break into the condo. So look out your window and see if you can see a neighbor who does nothing but look out the window or hangs out front doing nothing all day and you will know who to look out for. Again sorry for your loss, get a dog, I have several and be happy that this was horrible but is not the norm over here. That couple is gone now, evicted no surprise, and things have returned to normal until the next mules move in.

Just to point out facts- "minimal impact"- Officers are not dispatched from the station, no change in response time due to that, no impact. Yes, beats will be larger but that is because crime is dropped in 013 from when the district was made smaller, no impact here. If you were to check how many officers are on the street at any given time, I think you would be shocked-some weekends you might only have three officers on patrol out of that station. There are fewer coming through the neighborhood now with this station open- no impact. The one huge impact I know of as a fact is that the officers will be safer and work at processing arrestees faster in the brand new, up to date station,"more time on the beat, less time in the station processing". If you had to work in the accident waiting to happen 013 station building like I did, I believe you would also know why this death trap had to be closed. I am happy that an officer did not have to pay the ultimate price working in that unsafe building. Don't forget about the officers safety also when talking about this building.

I just noticed the location (Art/Pot). That's in the TWILIGHT ZONE! I am surprised a Police Officer would even live there! Things must have changed for the better a lot since I work there. I think that it is fantastic to learn about that area becoming so safe that even State Troopers can live there and park their patrol vehicles without being destroyed. Not the Twilight Zone no more, let's party!

I know that a police office can park anywhere while on a call for C.P.D.so an officer can make an illegal spot legal. A State Trooper is on duty as soon as they enter their patrol vehicle and state law might be different from city laws. As for me, with all that happens here, where a police vehicle is parked is at the very bottom of my list. In fact I would give my eye teeth to have a police vehicle park nearby my home, (that proves there is an officer nearby) even if it was parked illegally.

When a pawn shop tried to open at Kedzie and North Ave., we had public meetings and they asked if we wanted them (the pawn shop). We were notified about this and the meetings from the Alderman's office.We talked about OUR neighborhood and told them no thanks. They did not open here. No one asked if we (the residents near by) wanted a mega church or had a single meeting for OUR input in OUR neighborhood. We did not hear anything from the Alderman's office until after the sale was final. This is NOT neighborly and is a very BAD start for New Life church in OUR neighborhood. Any meetings they might have now will not address the concerns of us here so why go. This was done fast and quiet and smells of Chicago politics and I hope all will remember this when election day comes around again.

Went there last night and watched the game. If you are into sports, the six huge flat screens are unbelievably clear and the five speakers are so loud, my head rattled. A lot of the old bar is still there, a small area out back for smokers and was told sometimes BBQ's but no food menu. Also told the basement was to be turned into a party room soon. There is one pool table that was free when I was there and one Domino table and the place was full. After the game, the internet jukebox was turned on and the bongo music started and was so loud I could not talk with the person that was with me.The music was not to my liking and unable to hold a conversation,so we left. Everyone must make their own decision if this place is suited to their tastes.

Not one person on this thread thought this was a good idea! Now will all of you call Maldonado's office and put this bad idea to rest! I went to meetings about the lot years ago and across the street was going to be a drive thru Starbucks. The alderman at the time and several of his followers spoke against Starbucks, stating it was not what the neighborhood needed. Well look at the vacant lots and falling apart store that was to be a coffee shop, Just what the neighborhood did not need but the alderman and his crones were happy keeping the area down. Aldi's my but, we deserve better, Strak and Van'til or Domminks but that location is to small (2900 w Grand a better location). If you want a Night Club just walk down to North and Central Park and go to Andy's. The place has been closed several times for months at a time. This shows you how much we need a Night Club in west Humboldt Park! This area is not full of people on welfare or out of work, in fact, we are mainly working families who need to stop being treated as below the poverty level second class citizens.

I read what people who do not know HP, write on EB, that HP will never become gentrified and safe! My reply is- Riot Fest is proof how safe it is in HP and it is diversity, not gentrification that is what makes our neighborhood come back to life and how it was during Riot Fest!

The truth hurts and I am not ashamed for pointing out the truth! I never said anything against Waguespack as the death toll rises and innocent people like the victims here get shot. I am sorry to see our city return to the bad old days. We the voters are responsible for giving one party the power to waste our tax dollars and not provide the basic city services so we can walk down our streets in peace. In Chicago and Illinois only, criminals have rights and victims have none. It is the politicians that empower the criminal to boldly walk our streets shooting unarmed citizens for the pack on their back! This incident is a tragedy, but the real tragedy is this shooting could have been prevented and the next one that will happen in Waguespack ward soon because of Chicago politics. I did not inject R vs D politics into this tragedy but it is D politics which have made our environment so dangerous just to walk down the street. I hope these neighbors will be alright.

It is true that the Puerto Rican community honors Stas but it is incorrect to state they were the only ones to do so, like the title of this story indicates. Yes, HP WAS largely Puerto Rican but now those numbers are way down and the census shows others groups numbers doubling and Puerto Rican's move away and diversity has taken hold. No one group speaks for all the others. The WBEZ's reporter continually writes stories like this one, which does not recognize what is now the vast majority of the community in HP! That is why it is such a big deal. I was there to honor Stas and half of the people there I saw were not Puerto Rican, so to write me and all the others off an non-people like this reporter did is unjust to the HP community and what Stas was being honored for.

What a knee jerk reaction for votes and obviously without thought for the consequences, just what we could expect from a Chicago politician! There is a million better ways to handle this situation but the worst was chosen. Two wrongs do not make a right, shame on anyone who thinks so! A leader is suppose to do the right thing not just pander to the way the wind blows.

One less gang banger is not the solution, that is correct. If the families had significant anguish to do something to get their family member out of the gang they would be alive today. You choose to live by the sword and you die by the sword, to bad. Neighborhoods get better after half the bangers are in jail for killing the other half. I have seen neighborhoods change in days for the better after certain gang bangers were removed from society. I for one will show my grief for the seven year old girl shot while selling lemon aide with her mother in the middle of the day rather than a banger who caused her to get shot.

He said he saw no problems and the next week we had five shot with two killed so we had the the area voted dry at the next election. Your death toll is now equal to ours so good luck. Do you know if a vice team was sent at 2 A.M. to check for Liquor licenses after observing gang bangers enter after 2 A.M. the problem would be solved, it is that simple. Why don't they do that?

Can where CF did poorly, like HP, it be stopped? The study backs this up. I would have to write a book on how bad it is to give gang bangers money where the politicians use gangs to get out the vote or stop others from voting.

Gangs is what you get for that money spent. This money was wasted so the Mayor can say he did something more against gangs in Chicago.

Where were these studies done? If not in Chicago-screw them!

We have the most convicted felons as members of our city council, black panther leader and gang bangers as Congressmen and State Representatives and who knows what else as Aldermen. If I saw something CF had done all this time to make HP a better park, I would be for this all the way. I have seen what CF has done in HP and so has many on this thread apparently from what has been posted. If we do not learn from history, we will repeat it and continue the corruption. Might as well throw away 2 million of our tax dollars to them, this is way more important than work programs, after school projects and youth activities for the children who decided against becoming a gang banger in the first place!

(Community Comes Together for Police Commander Flores' Removal and Opposition to 'Riot Fest).....WRONG!!!!!! THESE INDIVIDUALS DO NOT REPRESENT THE HUMBOLDT PARK COMMUNITY! I have not heard one of my neighbors say anything bad about Riot Fest. In fact, most of my neighbors stated they are looking forward to it because it proves life is returning to HP in a big way. Riot fest was a supporter of PR Fest. Wonder if they think the PR Fest took their money and is now stabbing them in the back! Remember this the next time you deal with anyone from Casa Puertorriqueña! 
They did not have the right permits and the Commander did the job she is paid to do. What is the problem? Were these permits over looked in the years past? What do they cost? 
Why do these people think they speak for HP/me? Sounds to me like some people want everyone else to get out of HP! Change is here and going on strong, you might as well try to stop the wind from blowing!
Now if you really want to know what the HP community wants, you need to hear what the Beat and Block Clubs have to say! The meeting held at the HP field house by beats 1422 and 1423 (both sides of the park) with CPD Command staff was what the community (people that actually live here) do want and it is very different from what was stated at this meeting in which these beats were not invited.

My family and I stopped going to the fest (even real early) after several times being threatened and told to leave. I was happy to enjoy the fest and spend time with my neighbors, but that was taken away from my family by more than a few people having a good time, dancing, eating, getting on rides, children, families, maybe some gang bangers. I wish I had the rose colored glasses that some here are wearing but fests do come to an end, even after 30 years and to say the shooting, murders and gang banging that spike every year at fest time are not attributed to the fest is simple denial. Who here is the oppressor? I have yet to see gangs of white people telling Puerto Ricans that HP is %100 blanco and to get out but I have seen the no yuppie and HP is %100 PR signs at the parade making everyone feel welcome.

WHAT WAS SHE EVEN DRIVING FOR?!?, and the flag ties this to the PR Fest and criminal acts during the month. If she ran over the tent vendor or killed people a the bus stop or children at the nearby play ground this would have been headline news. As I was writing this on EB, my wife had a car speed up to her and my daughter going the wrong way on a one way, the driver jumped out and screamed at them he was being chased. Another vehicle skidded into the intersection and a man screamed out threats and foul language at the other then drove away fast as my wife took note of his actions. Other reckless drivers peeled around the intersection and plain clothes police officers pulled up and stopped a subject on a bicycle, all within moments of the crash!

There use to be Polish fests and Statues in the park but when the Polish residence moved away, so did the the fest and statues.

I wonder if gang bangers will be attacked to Riotfest and shoot and kill people like they do every PR Fest and the weeks before it? If it was just parking, fights and craziness at PR Fest, I do not think we would be having this discussion. I wish it was just two gangs causing the problems in HP this month but it is many returning from several states to terrorize what is becoming a quiet park. If it was a nice family fest like they say there would not be anyone talking about stopping it. It is horrible to hear that you need to watch what block you use and where to park your car so that you can survive this fest! I go to several other fests in the area (Do Division) where liquor is served and no need for hundreds of police officers to stop the blood shed like this one. Is there another fest in Chicago that has a body count, this one has four killed and a dozen shot already within a couple blocks of the park this year! Is this fair to the entire community?

No, your right B and H, it is not exclusive to the fest, I sorry if I was misunderstood. We have gang violence that is lowering every year but watch the violence happen more and more then top off the weekend of the fest. The numbers shot and killed do not lie. After the fest the gang activity drops off a cliff and does not return to this kind of body count until next year. The silver lining is that the numbers across the board are dropping with each year and I can not wait for the day that we have no gang shootings in the month of June. I hope we will all live to see that day.

I was told gang names were used during the shooting that happened as people left a party at 5 A.M.!!!

Went to the meeting last night at the park about the fest, sounds like police will be busy in the fest but no more extra help to us who have to fend for ourselves on the blocks around the park. I suggested a way to have extra police officers volunteer to work their day off on special details to issue tickets for open alcohol, loud music from vehicles and children riding on the hoods of vehicles. This would be a (win-win) situation like D.U.I. details are to the city! We would get the extra police we need to make HP safe during the fest and the city would make revenue from the citations issued to gang bangers and law violators. As of right now we pay for most of the police who work the fest and loose the protection of the officers pulled from their beats to keep gang bangers at bay at the fest. Hopefully the Mayor and the Police will try out these police details to add to our safety while saving huge tax payer dollars that the same time seeing that this fest is costing us and arm and a leg....literally!

I have lived in HP for over 10 years (Kedzie / Division) and will live here for the rest of my life. I worked this area for around 20 years and have always seen a noticeable increase in gang activity- shootings and killings in the few weeks prior to and through the Puerto Rican Fest. I have seen first hand several times, gang bangers return to HP and get shot down, as many as three at a time on Division St. in front of a ghetto liquor store we had closed down. The story was always the same, Gang member had moved away years ago but returned to celebrate PR Fest only to get killed, or an innocent bystander. A blue light camera was installed at Beach and Spaulding and the bangers no longer live on that corner. Most gang bangers on the west side of the park have moved away and gang activity is way down from past decade highs except now for the month prior to PR fest.

"Welcome to our neighborhood" Who do you mean when you say "our" and what is "WEPA!!!!"? When I moved into Humboldt Park with my family, I thought Humboldt Park was for everyone and not just one group to tell everyone else what to celebrate and when to do so! I have not seen one Polish flag selling tent in the park, time must have changed from when they had Polish parades that went down Humboldt Blvd. in the park. Time are a changing again it seems.

No Matthew A., He is not joking, he is telling you to get out of Humboldt Park if you do not like to vendors in the park. You can not keep things the way they were after that group has moved away, change can not be halted. I think it is great that tents are up for selling Puerto Rican pride merchandise but why in the park when the paseo was set aside for just this reason yet has mostly vacant lots and abandoned store fronts?

Evan, if someone used a megaphone in front of your house at 2 A.M. to scream free speech for four days, I bet you would be on the phone in a second demanding police use violence to suppress that individuals 1st amendment rights. I can not see anyone thinking " isn't that great and sing kum bye ya" while their own rights were being violated. All protesters were given a tremendous amount of leeway, so individuals that were arrested had to go way beyond the law and do not deserve the good treatment they received from Chicago's finest.
On another note, a big thank you to everyone who has "THANKED" me after I have received five "NO THANKS", proving that people that use the (no thank you) against EB policy still do not stop someone who is following EB policy correctly from being read!

k-dad, you have your opinion and it is good that you expressed it here on EB. I on the other hand can not see how when someone, an organization or politicians are quoted as saying they are against something based on a race that is mostly involved can be understood as anything but RACIST. Yes the Tipsey Cake Lady was inconsiderate when describing the shootings that to this day occur by her bakery but she never mentioned RACE. Those community leaders and Aldermen were wrong in their reaction. The community would have been better off if they had a protest against gang violence on that block instead of blowing smoke on the real problem of gangs and not of racism that was not there. I am not calling his statement racist because others were called racist, I am calling it racist because it was racist, plain and simple to me.

Again, look back to what the Tipsey Cakes lady said and how she was attacked for being a racist against Hispanics and Blacks by community leaders and politicians.

It was questioned at the meeting by others if RoitFest attracted gangs or had a history of drunk violence and if it did not it should be allowed the liquor permit.I for one am so happy that this event will that place and thousands of people will see that Humboldt Park is a beautiful place for everyone to enjoy!

And repeating that I am an (ex-cop), (a spin by the way and a non-issue)(look at my picture), will not stop me from writing on EB! Last,"Im guessing there is some politics going on.", I have no idea where you came up with that one, it's way out there for sure. I have noticed you read a lot into what I write but little as to what I write! Yes, I am an old ex-cop from Chicago, and believe it or not, I am as plain and easy to understand as the way I write and talk. I back up everything I say with my real name and picture so no secret political agenda or conspiracy. I walk around the park everyday with some of my dogs and get a little mad when I see garbage, homeless drinking in bands waiting for the church bus for handouts and now these food trailers, abandoned looking eye sores and I think, is this what I worked so hard for all these years? I believe Humboldt Park is better than this and it only takes one fried out old ex-cop to help start cleaning it up.

Do you know that the neighborhood of West Town goes as fer west as Humboldt Blvd? That is right, half of Humboldt Park (The Park), is not even in Humboldt Park on neighborhood maps and the area of Humboldt Park goes as far west and south as around Cicero Ave. and Chicago Ave. Now Logan Square has a taste of what it is like to be named in bad press when it does not deserve it.

Strap in everyone around Humboldt Park, this is just the beginning of what happens every year and it gets worse till it reaches the high point when the Puerto Rican Fest is going on. The gang bangers are returning and are acting like it is bad old days again. The good news is, after the fest is over and the gang bangers crawl back to wherever they came from, the gang shooting around HP drop to a level equal to the rest of the city. I have noticed that this trend has been getting smaller with every years passing and I hope it will end some day soon.

I talked with the CAPS Sgt. who walked by and she was unaware of why the lawn was not being mowed, but she stated something will be done. Remember, because of our Democratic politicians, THE CITY IS BROKE!!!!!!!, and I know when city contractors are not paid in months, they stop doing their jobs for the city. Maybe the lawn guys have not been paid in a while. The planters look great thanks Growing Pride garden club members who donated the flowers and time to plant them. I will post pictures on Flicker.

Raul, you gave me a fantastic compliment that makes all my hard work worth it! You remembered me from one of the few who stood up and represented hundreds who signed a petition against the La Estancia (THE STAND) Project! Now I know that I made a mark and an impression on individuals against change for the better years later. For that I THANK-YOU. Even though politicains stated we ask for the project, the truth was my neighbors wanted no part of it in the area it was built. Remember, the gas station that could not make a living on the corner of Division/California, and then sat vacant for a long time (you know like the vancant lot on the north/east corner now). A private developer purchased the land, received permits to build four stories of condos for private ownership (great tax base) but was forced to sell to the city (at tax payer expence) then sold to Bickerdike for a DOLLAR!!!!, to build the no tax base project that is the stand! I think most people would say it is racist to build a building with tax dollars and say this is the stand against non-Puerto Ricans moving in! The No Se vende / NoYuppies groups are out and out RACIST, that is just fact, are you showing that you are a member when you state (my focus is preserving the Puerto Rican identity of this community I so love), do you want to keep out other groups? You come across loud and clear to most on this thread, like you say we do to you.
On this thread I believe everyone wants the same thing (rich or poor, HP hater or not), we all want to live in peace and not to be forced by the powers that be to live where they want us to live.
This also includes not having gangbangers return to the old hood and settle their differences by shooting each other in the head like how this thread started. You want to start a thread about racism on EB, please do, I would enjoy to continue a dialogue and exchange with you so more can read about your point of view and mine to.

There all gone now, the last Polish smoked meat shop just closed and is for sale on the 2700 west block of Division St. That's change for you.

brain, it is refreshing to read that someone understands what gentrification is about in Chicago. I have been to several community meetings where gentrification is spoke as if it was a four letter word, and even read it in some questionable papers in HP. There are groups that seem to want the gangs to stay (NO CHANGE)! They call whites racist if they talk about shootings in HP (Tipsey Cake owner). I read about a collage doing a study how gentrification is harming HP, can you believe that!
alex, I do not think it was called gentrification by the Polish when the Puerto Ricans started moving in. I have never read that Polish groups had campaigns like - do not sell (NO SE VENDE),(NO YUPPIES), or had Polish flags placed across streets as to say this area is for Polish only. I worked here when the flags went up and hate crimes against non-Puerto Ricans/whites went through the roof and the hate crimes continue to this day but mainly during the PR fest only now. It sucks when my children are told by bangers that they do not belong in HP and to get out at almost every PR Fest. Everything changes and the gangs and crime leaving HP because of gentrification is a change for the better. I like this change so I guess some others like change also.

Alex did you read the Reader? 5 year old shouting his gang name to the police. 5 YEAR OLD GANG MEMBER!!!!!! Dealers say it only weed and out to make a little cash in front of police in the middle of the day! These are the residents, not like the bangers that return in my area during the PR Fest and leave when it is over! The article is actually pro PARK and telling how it is south of Grand Ave. I learned a great deal from the article, Puerto Rican riots in 66 and again in 77, when working class people moved out and the criminals took over. It also pointed out that gentrification is reclaiming the park but not the area that is mostly African-American. Can you believe some people still think gentrification is a bad thing!!! If gentrification means less gangs, crimes and killings, I say give me gentrification and criminals can PUSH OFF!! Again, buildings do not make a neighborhood bad, the criminals that live in them do! You know criminals have to live somewhere (they are not about to change their ways), and I know they do not want to live anywhere near me, I CALL THE POLICE and because of the job I held, I tell them face to face to PUSH OFF!!!!......Have a nice day. NOTE- I suggest anyone else not to confront a gangbanger like I do unless they also have the three decades of training in the art that I have under my belt.

About a week ago during a storm late in the evening I heard a knocking at my front window. My wife answered the door to find a hispanic female stating she was a neighbor from down the block and need to buy diapers for her baby and had dvd to sell (we just gave her some cash). Now last night, had another female hispanic in her 20's knocking on my window (both not using doorbell???), stated she was a neighbor from down the block had been beaten (not a mark on her) and robbed of her rent money a few days ago and asked (get this) for 20 or 40 dollars!!! She got squat. Are they checking out if anyone is home/burglars, could this be the same as above? I have not heard of this scam! Just info for everyone.

Here we go again, First I wrote the HP map goes to around Cicero/Chicago Ave.'s, The Reader is not the only story about crimes in that area AKA HP! Next, Pulaski/Chicago Ave.'s are ONE AND A HALF MILES away from HP! Anyone that knows the area, knows as soon as you go west of Kedzie on Chicago Ave you are no longer in the PARK. In fact, I would go as far as you have left the planet, The Reader discribes that area to a T and makes in new understanding to the saying "wrong side of the tracks"!!!! I can not make my case more strongly-(that area should not represent the PARK)!!! Now as for the maping, Ukrainain Village had their boundaries defined in City Hall. Politicians in Chicago will do just about anything for a vote and with this, no cost- no brainer, should fly through City Hall. The area around the park- Chicago Ave. to Bloomingdale / Western to Central Park )staying north of Grand Ave. is by no means small and with out a doubt defines the area of and around HUMBOLDT PARK. To save HP from being known as 'the most dangerous neighborhood in the Nation.' we (the true residence of HP) must demand the city to recognize this realistic maping of HP! One more note, yes as a former Chicago Policer, I have talked to my 1121 beat officers, who agree that they very little violent crime calls on 1121's beat north of Grand Ave. compared to the rest of the beat/district and I recall one officer calling the area as HOLLYWOOD and should not be in the 011 district! But do not quote me on that.

Alex, Thanks to foreclosures my daughter owns a condo across the street from me that she could not have been able to afford when sold new and I made a great purchase of a two flat grey stone a few blocks away and have fantastic tenants compared to the banger buildings on the block! Yes foreclosures have a good side to them here. As for the Reader, the key is (WEST HUMBOLDT PARK)!!!! If you look at some maps, the area know as WEST HUMBOLDT PARK goes as far west as CICERO AVE. and as far south as CHICAGO AVE.!!! that is like saying Damen and Armitage is East HP! I go insane every time that area of the 011th District is in a paper for the sewer that it is and in bold print, it is named HUMBOLDT PARK, what stupidity!!! The first thing we HP residents need to do to restore HP's good name is to have the boundaries for HP clearly defined by the city as a two or four block area around HUMBOLDT PARK like the Ukrainain Village did and is the only neighborhood to do so in city council. People that do not know that the murders and gang crime reported like in the Reader happen miles from HP and that is why you will hear from unknowing individuals calling the park a hell hole and do not understand why anyone would live here. They just don't know the true HP and we continue to get a bum rap from the press due to a line on a map which is unjust. It is like you stating you live in Ukrainian Village when a map shows that you do not, But the way Ukrainian Village as spread so far west you are probably accurate! Ask gpdlight about the area the Reader is writting about and the difference should be perfectly clear! At least that area is now being called (WEST) HP and not just HP.

Andy, I am glad you noticed the same change to HP as a lot of us caring neighbors have. Buildings do not make a neighborhood bad but criminals living in low income buildings do. The foreclosures that have happened by me on the westside of HP have wiped out the gangbanger presence more than the police ever could! I would see several bangers drinking, gambling and gang signing in front of the buildings they lived in for years. Then for whatever reason the building would be foreclosed and boarded up and then sold to good people that care for their property and HP. Foreclosures have moved out so many bangers that entire blocks are beautiful now and no one would have believed the change for the better if they do not see it for themselves. Foreclosures have removed properties from gangbangers and slum landlords and have helped clean up HP from what I have noticed. Bye bye bangers and good riddance.

First - birds of a feather flock together- let us take the high road and just ignore the subjects who have the right to talk about things they have no knowledge about and be thankful they do not live here whith such narrow minded beliefs.
Second-no alex, read my comment again, 60's to 80's you could not walk down any block around the park or in the park without being invilved in gang violence! Now, most of the signs of gang activity have vanished except for when the PR fest returns and so return all the gang members to act like it is the old days again from where they moved away to. There used to be four gang bangers shot at one location in HP at any given time, now it is down to one gang banger (who does not live in HP like this one) and returned to HP and learned the hard way that the good old days are over forever!!! Watch the news, sadly a little gang violence continues in HP but as the PR fest get closer more violence will occure to a yearly high and then after the PR fest is over, it drops to all most a vanishing point until next year. I have observed this first hand for over a decade now and it gets better with every passing year and I hope one day it will be gone as it is in West Town, Buck Town and West Buck Town. Can anyone remember when the gang violence was just as bad there as it was in HP over ten years ago?!?! I for one see a day when Division St west of Western Ave looks just like Division St east of Western Ave now. They looked the same only a few years ago and individuals called it a living hell to!!!! As I said before, It is getting better in HP with every day that passes!!!! HP's future is very bright and this crap will be only history soon.

Mariann Pepitone, if your information is from the fifties, it is a little old. HP has not been mainly Puerto Rican for over a decade. Also all the gangs that alex trebeck pointed out have all but vanished from there all time highs in the 60's to 80's, except for the few that return during the PR fest or end up dead in an alley like this banger did. If you do not know HP then you should not bad mouth it. I have noticed only people that do not live anywhere near HP talk extremely bad about it (a living hell) and that is shamefull.

The Subway was a Robbery and not on the block. My heart goes out to that working womans family members, hope they catch the robber. I worked your block and the area known as (THE TWILIGHT ZONE) in 88. One holloween, what started out as an egg fight ended a few days later with 12 shot and a few of them dead in that time. There were four shootings in 8 hours at Campbell and Potomac, as soon as the police left, another banger got shot, it was unreal. Today even the dead banger memorials in front of the church are gone (used to be replaced on the days of their killings for months). Sucks when a gang banger returns to the hood and acts like it is the old days again! Be glad it only lasts till arrested again or shot. I do not consider you a hater, most people have no idea how bad it was just a few years ago. Just wait another few years and you will be able to sell at several times what you payed for your home, that is if you still want to leave! I was working in the area when the Police Officer was shot in the arm. Clemente H.S. was letting it's 'Students' out when they started shooting at each other and the Police Officer was in the line of fire and was hit. Now they have security on every corner down Division to California and stagger dismissal. You moving in and hard working Police officers is why the area is so safe now from what it was. Hope my information was a help to you and you are pretty safe now even if you do not feel like it.

What is messed up is that banger should have been with his two year old son instead of that alley doing what?!? Was not seeing his dad then. The point is that the cobra affiliate was not a resident of HP because the area is getting better as the bangers move out! As for being a gang banger, I will quote the paper "Police suspected the shooting to be drug-related, but offered no additional details. Benitez, who police said was affiliated with the Spanish Cobras street gang, had at least 30 arrests and several felony convictions for drugs, according to court records." Who is not telling the truth here, The court records must be fake.The problem here is someone figured a banger with several felony convictions would make a good father to a child!

Hi Mama, To make myself clear, there is no question that gentrification is making HP a better place to live and I never said ALL low income buildings are bad. Now like with this building and when you have entire blocks of only low income multi units buildings how do you think private ownership will start or if anyone would want to near that block? I hope I answered your question. All of Chicago low income projects have been torn down because of crime. Now why do you think when crime is high in HP and we already have more low income buildings then probably the rest of the city, the politicians keep taking building from the private sector and building four story high low income buildings?

Sorry to hear the gangs forced you out of HP, glad to hear you still have family here. Do you also know that the city of Chicago is considered the most culturally divided city on the planet, this is very bad! There will always be Puerto Ricans in HP. There is still a lot of Polish families in HP and I have Black, Jewish and German neighbors. Hopefully HP will become the first truely diverse neighborhood in Chicago and that will make me very very happy. To do this we must all band together and say NO MORE LOW INCOME HOUSING IN HP!

— On the neighbor message Corner Building Rockwell and Evergreen?

Yes Laura, Jewish and German, before those groups, I do not know. The politicians never erected flags to a certain group, and then stopped private development, taking their property and handing the land over to low income groups for a dollar. Some of the buildings become a hub for gang/drug activity like this one and should be returned to the private sector and sold to a developer for the good of the neighborhood. It also shocks me when the statement "gentrification/gangs/or another major group" are made! How and why would anyone associate gentrification with gangs? Like gentrification is a problem! I will agree with you- "Puerto Ricans are not the problem in HP", in fact I believe they are the answer! My good hard working, home owning neighbors of all races welcomed my family into HP and know that that gentrification means less gangs and crime and most welcome that change.J.W., are you now call me a liar? You are off topic again, you have yet to make a statement on topic, you name call and obviously know nothing about HP. I will not answer to any more of your remarks!

Laura,I can agree with some of your point of view but again I think a lot of people living in HP would disgree with what you say as fact. Again Google- Latin Kings and you will find out the dangerous gang started around 1950 so the gang problem we know today started a little farther back then when you say it did. HP was a mainly Polish neighborhood with Polish Parades before Puerto Ricans started to move in and they were forced out. My relatives that use to live here did not want to move. Do you know that HP had many statues to Polish leaders but had to be removed to the lake front because gangs actually used ropes and pulled them down? Do you not know of the murel on the dollar store at Washtenaw and Division commemorating a riot and burning of police vehicle. A lot of my Puerto Rican neighbors tell me they wish the Puerto Rican Fest would stop in HP due to the fact of all the gangbangers that return and people getting shot and killed and they will not go to it. Google- person shot at Puerto Rican Fest. Every fest menbers of my family receive racist attacks and gangs rule the streets on the weekend! If the PR Fest was made as safe as the Southside Irish Fest was this year maybe my family could enjoy it. It is called change and nothing can stop it, not even illegal actions done by city politicians. I moved here for several reasons, one of which was so I could raise my children in diverse community, little did I know they would be targets of hate crimes because of the color of their skin. Laura, when did you move in Hp and do you think you are part of the problem of gentrification? Do you not see that the flood of low income housing, like this building is destroying HP?!? Change of the better is good don't be saddened by it. My Puerto Rican neighbors that got a job, bought their homes and did not join gangs are not going anywhere and are happy the area is getting more safe for their children. I am glad they are staying my neighbors! That is what is making HP great.

You need do a little research before you make such statements or you are the one who looks silly. Also don't you think it is sad that the two low income buildings on the passeo are the best looking and a private developer had his property taken and permits pulled so a tax base lowering low income building could be built by Bickerdike instead. Bickerdike paid 1 dollar for the property that the city had to pay the developer 1.25 MILLION of our tax dollar for, some good, I do not think so.

I think we can meet half way and have close to the same goals. Now come on "Crack Cakes", she opened a store here, gave people here jobs and even when she makes a ignorant statements she has done a lot of good for HP. Her store is still here and she did not give in to the bad reputation that HP has because of what we are talking about now. Was the shooter in front of a Hispanic housing building? Why don't those groups and the Aldermen that call her a racist and bad for HP now go boycott CHA for the very high concentration of low income housing in HP that we know is bad for HP?!? No that is not about to happen because they keep passing out our tax dollars for more. If I wanted to start a boycott and demonstrate on the news to make HP better, the Crack Cakes statement would be far down on my list if at all. Leaders are to set an example, they did wrong, they should appologize! You stated "People don't like their people being called animals", are these gangbangers destroying HP your people? That might sound racist to some people and you maybe boycotted! I will not ever be compassionate when it comes to the gangbanging criminals that think they can sell drugs, gang sign and shoot up HP. They act worse than animals (I love my dogs, sorry for the disrepect dogs), and don't care what race, creed or religion they are and I believe my good neighbors to not cringe when I call criminals what they act like. In fact most my my neighbors are tired of the gangs and thank me for standing up against them and we have helped clean up a lot of the westside of the park.

hpresident,I did not appreciate her statement either but they labeled her a racist! She talked about the same thing we are now talking about but in an careless manner. Are we now racist? She made no racist statements yet she was wrongly called a racist in the press. I was taught to apologize when I do something wrong so we will have to agree to disagree. How could be possibly offended as you now talk about shootings in HP, the same thing she talked about. I also believe in the freedom of speech so if you want to make a list of "terms that needs to be put to rest" and not use them I prefer you not talk to me about them. I read a racist articial that stated something like (remember the gang members the are destroying HP are brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles also mothers and farthers), that made me sick. They deal drugs,shoot and kill innocent people and shoot at police/security officers, and when caught they are caged in prisons. So I will never get warm and fuzzy with criminals and call them just other human beings. Agree to disagree again. This thread sucks because I believed that HP was past this type of criminal activity on the eastside of the park. At least it is one more shooter off the streets!

Yes, Hispanic Housing have hired private security guards to patrol all of the scattered site homes a few years ago in HP. There is even a phone number to call when you see illegal activity going on at one of the section eight buildings. HEY, isn't this around the corner from Tispey Cake?!?! Do you think those groups and the Aldermen that attacked the owner of the bakery for racism should now appologize publicly to her?!?! This is the second shooting to occure by the bakery since the boycott. It appears her petty statement was very accurate and not racist at all! To bad the news will not describe the race of the offender so we can tell those groups and the Aldermen just how wrong they really are!

J.W. Why label me that way, knowing most Democrates in Chicago hate Republicans without a reason, shame on you. As I have been consistently saying, HP is getting better everyday, I invite you to see what my neighborhood has been able to acomplish on the westside of the park! We lost against The Stand Project, but we banded together and voted Division St. dry closing down a gang banger attracking, getto liquor store (this alone opened the eyes of our Alderman to what we together can do)! We have turn vacant lots into community gardens and this has attracted private development, we also stopped L.U.C.H.A. in it's tracks from flooding our neighborhood with low income dumps like this one causing so much problems on the eastside of the park. If the neighbors to this low income dump, banded together and went to the Alderman and demanded this unwanted and unnessary flood of low income housing to stop, they will go elsewhere. We did it on the westside of the park. Now you tell me-what is nonsense about that?!? We have fought hard to make HP a beautiful park again, why do you think the politicians are fighting so hard to destroy everything we have gained. I have been nothing but consistent and can not figure why you can not see that or understand what I am saying!

I must not have made myself clear enough when I stated " that shows how racist these project builders are". The builders in charge are making the racist statements listed above not the community center/low income dump they are building. Now let us think about that, The La Estancia Project-The Stand Project, I have been at meetings where people stated openly this is for Puerto Ricans to make a stand against being forced out of HP! Zappada Projects on Armitage "a Mexican hero" used illegal zoning to build, sued and forced by the neighborhood to start over, now being built against the neighbors overwhelming rejection of it and Hispanic Housing- scattered site section eight rentals that were supposedly to be sold after twenty years (ain't happening). Now can anyone tie a community center with racism? Let's see what would happen if we changed the names to The Gentrification Project, The Davy Crockett Project and Caucasian Housing! I wonder how many groups would be screaming RACISM, RACISM!!!!! like what happened to that poor baker who insensitively talked about shootings in Humboldt Park!

Not all low income people are gang affiliated and looking to cause problems. I never said they all are bad. My question is why so much in such a small area in Humboldt Park and to stop other private developers and force them to sell to the city. Then the city sells the property to Bickerdike (millions of tax dollars for the property, and sold to Bickerdike for a dollar in most cases) and they build the same building but low income, almost always where gentrification is taking root. They are building a wall, Augusta- Cal. to Sacremento, Division- Western to Cal., Rockwell- North to Hirsch and now North Ave- Campbell to Washtenaw! It is all mainly Bickerdike or Hispanic Housing. The Stand Project on Division west of Kedzie to this day still has all but one store front vacant and all other businesses on Division has closed down. The last three large CPD drug/gang raids were all on blocks that were mainly low income housing in HP! Most housing projects in Chicago were torn down because high concentrations of low income buildings in a small area became high crime locations. Then why are our tax dollars being used to build multi-unit low income buildings around HP and most private development halted?

— On the neighbor message Building construction??

It is another low income Bickerdike property. I heard it was taken away from owner and sold to Bickerdike for next to nothing (lowering our tax base) to stop evil gentrification from making the neighborhood better.

You have got to be joking when you said "the fact that most of the "riots" in Chicago have actually been initiated by the police." For that to occur, police would have to force protestors to gather than force them to break the law (you know when they are peacefully demonstrating) and then force the city to order the police to keep the peace so the police can riot. Was it not just seven terrorist that caused the many protesting sheep to riot in the 60's? I have heard of police riots but never heard about a riot that the police started! I have heard at public meetings, police officers called murderers as they defended themselves from attack and it made me sick! I am gald G8 is gone, there would have be more criminals there hiding behind the right to protest then peaceful protesters acting like sheep so that the criminals could destroy Chicago. Going to peacefully protest at G8 makes a much sence as running into a tornado just to see what damage it does.

@ Jason W, why do anti-CCW people like you play the race card for no reason at all? You opened the door- I will step through-Yes, I believe everyone knows that the #1 killer of males of color between the ages of 16 and 24 are males of color between the ages of 16 and 24! The numbers change drastically from being shot or witnessing a shooting when you live in HP. It is people like me that are more likely to be a victim of a burglary, battery, theft, armed robbery because drug dealers are moving out and people who have something to steal are moving in. If I still lived in Lincoln Park, I would probably would not be on this thread, but I had to move. I considered myself lucky to find a great place over looking HP, a diverse neighborhood where I can raise my children. Little did I know my family would be racially assualted time and time again (NO YUPPIES etc..), be vitims of thefts and threats. I have heard shots and then found dead bodies within a block of my home a few times now. One banger shot down the street, crashed the car he was driving and died across the street in front of my home (probably where you got-I am more likely to be hit by a car from). It seems like a war to me. What really scares me is that a lot of my neighbors think this is no big deal, I have been told "this has been going on for decades, you are not going to change anything"- "you moved here, they were here before you". I can not just move and they are wrong, I can and have changed things (helped close a gang banger liquor store , active member of block clubs and now fighting for my Consitutional right to defend my family where ever I am! So until you are willing to move my family to a place that crime does not occur, your smoke will not misdirect me from trying to keep my family safe against all the criminals carring guns in HP!

I live off of an intersection and clean the parkway and a vacant lot daily, animals stop at the light and throw out their trash and liquor bottles, mainly on the weekends. One day as I was cleaning up the parkway, a vehicle pulled up to me with two male blacks in it (music banging-dope smoke pouring out the open window), they waited for the light to change and then threw a bag of trash at my feet and yelled "now pick that up!". I for one am glad to read the animals are moving out of HP and keep cleaning up my block.

OK she is rude, but she does not deserve the racist attack she is under. Here is what I posted on another racist blog calling for a boycott!
WOW!!! Straight to the race card! How typical of the groups that use it, just can not rationally talk about the gang violence. Scream it was a racial attack, call for a boycott and take the spot light off the gang violence that does occur in Humboldt Park. Boycott this store because they talk about gang violence but the same groups never said boycott the Puerto Rican Fest when gang members have shoot outs on the passeo during the fest and people are shot and killed! Race was never mentioned in the interview so why bring it up? If the baker hated people of color, why did she open a store here, why did she just leave another vacant store front on the block if she did not want to improve the neighborhood, provide jobs and pay taxes. Thats right boycott the bakery out of the neighborhood and prove to everyone that it is bad to open a business here not only because of the gang violence but because of the racism here.
One last thing, to the above statement “First, those gangbangers are brothers, fathers, uncles, sisters, mothers, aunts and they are all SOMEBODY’s child.” you forgot to add that they are the criminals that are killing Humboldt Park as they kill SOMEBODY’s elses child! I would say there is a big problem here if mothers, fathers, anuts and uncles are still gang banging!

I can not believe what I read on the other blog listed above, calling this racist against people of color when they are the ones being racist against her. Humboldt Park is not made up of only Puerto Ricans and blacks and as gentriication takes hold in Humboldt Park the crime rate goes down, explain that! My neighbors of all races joined a block club, changed laws and voted Division St dry closing a liquor store that was a center for gang violence, getting together to stop gang violence should be the topic of the discussion!

Alex, I will repeat myself, no one should feel attacked or attack anyone else on this thread and those individuals should stop! We must talk to each other here. Back to topic-Race must be a big player to why you have attended 20 fests and not been around any assaults. You must not have left the police controlled fest area also. As for rioting and burning police cars, you should check the history that is the begining of the PR Fest with police officers have to fire thier guns to protect themselves when they where attacked. I suggest you go look at the murel painted on the east side of the Family Dollar store at Washtenaw and Division commemorating the event (the burning police car in it). I have attended meeting where the police are discribed as murders in this incident, this made me sick. Last I am a American, as my children, and a fest has not gone by without one member of my family being assaulted by racial slur (YUPPY GET OUT OF HP-HP 100% BORIQUAN NO YUPPIES)! Why does this happen at this supposedly dry family oriented event. Have you not seen the NO YUPPIE float and signs on the paseao? Alex we must be talking about two different PR Fests!

These two individuals were in a group of over a dozen on the corner of Division/Kedzie for over an hour and most vehicles driving by represented back to show they were gang bangers to.

Eric, we must keep lines of communication open and not get mad at someone that has not seen what we have. There are a lot of people that have no idea of the blood shed that occurs around HP and only of the police state that the PR Fest itself is. Go to the PR Fest, see the army of police there, walk around and you will never loose sight of an officer. There is a reason for this, I have seen what happened when the police were pulled from the corners of the park and the gangs have taken over the streets, at least on the west side of the park. I invite all non-believers to join me Friday and Saturday evening at Division/Kedzie for a front row seat.

Alex you are one lucky person indeed. Use person or people shot at PR Fest, I used Yahoo web search not google (sorry). That is what SCARES me, that the people in power dont think things are out of control and expect the gang shootings at every PR Fest and believe the neighborhood is ok with it. I personally know of several shooting over the years. Keep looking, maybe under police officers assaulted/person killed at PR Fest. Still nothing about anyone shot or killed at SS Irish Fest, you did not get your skull knocked in, I am glad to hear that. Two years ago a gang banger threatened to shoot me within feet of my home as I video taped them smoking drugs etc.I handed the pictures to police, I guess I have to go to Utube to have something happen.

If you have other information can you share it. I will agree most people drinking on the street (drunken fights) breaking the law at SS Irish Fest compared to half the people going to the PR Fest being gang members (from outside Chicago), gang signing, throwing bricks and bottles with the occasional shooting/murder in the Humboldt Park area starting weeks prior to the PR Fest is much, much worse!

Anti-Gun Justice Becomes Victim of Armed Robbery
By Michael Filozof

Ah, yes. There is such a thing as "poetic justice" after all! It seems
that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a 1994 Clinton
appointee, was the victim of an armed home-invasion robbery in his
vacation home on St. Kitts and Nevis. (Read the report at
http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2012/02/10/fbi-nevis.html )

Breyer voted against the majority in two recent landmark gun-rights
cases: District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008 and McDonald v. Chicago
in 2010, both 5-4 decisions. In Heller, the Supreme Court held that
the Second Amendment granted Americans the constitutional right to
possess a handgun in the home for self-defense, and the Court applied
(or "incorporated") that right to the states in McDonald. Breyer
denied that the Constitution granted Americans the right to armed
self-defense in his dissenting opinions.

Breyer also made a laughingstock of himself back in 1999 by citing the
Supreme Court of Zimbabwe --- yes, Zimbabwe! -- in two death penalty
cases, Moore v. Nebraska and Knight v. Florida.

So... a Supreme Court justice who voted to deny Americans the right to
defend themselves with a handgun, and who cited the phony court of a
notorious Third World dictatorship, finds himself defenseless against
a machete-wielding robber in a Third World tourist trap....
Priceless!!!

(The tragedy of the whole thing is that Breyer probably still doesn't
"get it"...)

Now you know when I said (drops to nothing) it was a measurement from what violence occurs during the PR Fest and after, not the normal (I hate to say it) ammount of crime that happens the rest of the time. I must correct you on one thing, The city did not shut Irish fest down but the organizers of the Irish Fest themselves did because of the same drunkin stupidity you point out. Now if you think drunkin beat downs are more violent then being shot to death in the streets like what happens at almost every PR fest, then yes, we will have to "agree to disagree".

Watch the news and you will see how shootings and gang violence spike weeks before the fest in the area around Humboldt Park.

I know about the drunken fighting that shut down the Irish Fest but not many have seen the drive by shootings with 4 shot, one of them killed on Division at Spaulding like I have. I have seen gang members waving a PR flag on a 1x2 board one moment then using it to break car windows and beat the driver inside, throwing bricks and bottles until an army of police arrive to stop it. I am not sure why they don't make headlines during the fest but I believe if people knew what violent crimes occur and loss of life, it would be shut down also. If you live in Humboldt Park like my family does, I believe you would change your mind in a second as to which fest is safer.

Now let us be heard from the Aldermans office to the Governor's, if you are elected offical who violates the voters civil rights and waste out tax dollars doing so your days are numbered! I think it is time for a Republican Governor!

Most people in the other 49 states do not carry guns and do not have to and enjoy the peace that CCW brings because the criminal does not know if they are carring or not.

Tom G, I try, most studies are not worth the paper they are written on when you check to see how the study was done. A great Republican President allowed all retired police officers to CCW (most democrates did not like this) and then the highest court ruled CCW to be legal and crime has beem falling ever after. I do not need a study to figure out why this is happening. I have read papers where police chiefs who did not want CCW in their towns and did everything to stop it changed their minds and had to agree that after CCW was allowed in their area, crime went down and they did not need to hire more police to fight crime. How many times do poeple need to be shown that 2+2=4, what do you do when they will not listen to reason and fact.

@ Cyndi, I think it is fantastic you know your limitations and will not carry even if the law allows you to. But I think you missed the point most here are trying to make. 1 The supreme court has already ruled that CCW is legal but in Illinois the politicians are breaking that law by not allowing CCW in this state (I say vote the bums out). 2 The truth about what happens to crime when CCW is allowed (example the other 49 states). I am sorry to hear what has happened to my neighbors in this thread (glad that they are ok)and do not want to be victimized hoping that the criminal will only take my money and not my life.

Removing guns does not work and allowing CCW does work, all the facts show this. If you think groups like cease fire lowered crime, you never saw them in action.

Now let us try following the law on this issue and if does not work, change the law.

Police reports change and crime goes down and as for crime going down across the country, it did just after CCW was allowed again by the Supreme Court. I do not want to scare anyone, I just state the fact that at every G8/NATO meeting it has happened and it will happen here. Maybe it would not be so bad if the rioters knew CCW was allowed here to.

B Jedi now you see when I said Democrates in this city and state do not like to follow the law, that is because most of them are criminals. @ Beach/Homan, I checked the numbers of officers on the job at the begining of this year and it was just over 9000, also talked to several officers who stated they will be retiring before the G8/NATO riots. I do not want to scare people but the city will burn because our mayor has no idea what is about to happen and there is not enough police offices in chicago to contol the mob that is on it's way. Those with closed minds to the facts will not listen to reason, I just want my government to obey the laws written in our constitution. Am I asking for to much?

Yes, this topic has been talked about on another thread, but we must continue to talk about it every chance we get until Illinois follows the constitution like the other 49 states. If our Governor vetos a civil right under the constitution for the citizens of Illinois, he must be voted out of office. I will be at that meeting and talk about being violated by Democrates in this state and city who decide what laws they what to abide by or the laws that do not suit them and they ignore! As for people who think law abiding citizens who waited for the law to change to carry a gun legally will get mad and shoot everyone down in the street because they have the choice to carry one is insane and their minds are closed to all facts from the other 49 states.

I call it a plot because they know that the high number of votes are need to stop us citizens from voting for a different map. As for the good old Republicans down south, yes Republicans can be criminals to, but I hope they do not learn anything from Chicago Democrats, for they are in a league of their own. With Blogo in the lead, Aldermen making the most racist wards maps ever seen (most segregated city in the world), a list of Governors in the joint (the one Republican was more a Democrate with doing away with the death penalty) and our current Governor stated, he will veto any carry/concealed laws even though 49 states have it and the supreme court ruled in is a right per the Consititution. Do not forget that Chicago has the highest number of convicted felons in it city council and not one of them is a Republican. No term limits, ripping up air port runways in the middle of the night (only the F.A.A. can close an airport or a Demoncrate that is above the law) and not paying into city worker pensions for decades against a court order to do so. I could go on for hours. I am proud to be a Republican in Chicago rather than supporting the Democrate filth that runs this city in the ground.

The criminals have just gone through my neighborhood of West Humboldt Park, going into occupied condo complexes removing several A.C. compressors from back court yards. Like a wave they hit block after block. Get use to this people, the criminals have learned we are down to below 9000 police officers from the 13500 officers we pay taxes for to this day. Everyday that goes by more and more officers retire and last year the city hired only 49 officers with around 700 officers leaving the department. It is only going to get a lot worse before it gets better. It takes over 9 months to hire and train more officers.Maybe hire an retired officer to be security. F.Y.I. Did you know that at times the entire 13th District only has 9 officers on patrol, does this answer why these crimes are happening?

I wish my aldermen worked as hard as Alderman Malonado's office did. The Alderman before the one we have now showed up in city hall and actually spoke in favor of the gang infested ghetto liquor store and that is why we had to change the laws and vote the precinct dry around him. By the way, he now works for the Governor in charge of low income housing funds I hear (the fox in charge of the hen house). C.P.D. with C.A.P.S. did what they could but now even C.A.P.S. is almost gone. Our neighborhood is beautiful, but we must continue to move out the criminals to make it safe.

Hello everyone, I am the one who started this thread. I just want to point out, what you read here used to be an every other week occurance with gang members shot or killed a few times a year. I posted this because it is not the norm any longer. Like I first said, I can not remember a shooting on this block since the United Blocks of West Humboldt Park (our neighborhood organization) banded together and had the precinct voted dry by 80% of the vote in the last election, closing a gang infested ghetto liquor store which was the source of the problem. My neighbors and I are jumping for joy as life returns to the 3200 W block of Division St. and crime is way down. Let me also point out we had little to no help from the Aldermen we had and the police were overwhelmed (8000 officers when we pay taxes for 13500). We still did it ourselves, crime down and anyone can do it to their neighborhood too. I am scared to think what is going to happen to the city when G8 and N.A.T.O. are in town! I know I am happy with what is happening in my neighborhood and sorry about his shooting.

Just a final note on gun control, here is a story you might not have read but you should think about.
TEEN SHOOTS ILLIGALS...ONLY FOX NEWS MENTION IT.

BUTTE, MONTANA

Shotgun preteen vs. Illegal alien Home Invaders...

Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably
believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia
Harrington after her father had left their two-story home.
It seems the two crooks never learned two things: they were in Montana and
Patricia had been a clay-shooting champion since she was nine.

Patricia was in her upstairs room when the two men broke through the
front door of the house. She quickly ran to her father's room and grabbed his
12-gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun.

Resindez was the first to get up to the second floor only to be the
first to catch a near point blank blast of buckshot from the 11-year-old's
knee-crouch aim. He suffered fatal wounds
to his abdomen and genitals.

When Garza ran to the foot of the stairs, he took a blast to the left
shoulder and staggered out into the street where he bled to death
before medical help could arrive.

It was found out later that Resindez was armed with a stolen 45-caliber
handgun he took from another home invasion robbery. That victim,
50-year-old David 0'Burien, was not so lucky. He died from stab wounds
to the chest.

Ever wonder why good stuff never makes NBC, CBS, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, or ABC
news........?

An 11 year old girl, properly trained, defended her home, and
herself......against two murderous, illegal immigrants.......and she
wins,
She is still alive.

Now THAT is Gun Control!

Thought for the day....
Calling an illegal alien an
'undocumented immigrant'
is like calling a drug dealer an
'unlicensed pharmacist'

I like this kind of e-mail! American citizens defending themselves and
their
homes.

I heard that an off duty office was working security at la pasadita when the shoot out occured and he also shot at the gang members.la pasadita hires off duty officers because of the gang problems they have. la pasadita will always be a gang magnet.

Jason Walker, I'm afraid your source that conducted that survey in just 5 days and did not point how many subjects were questioned. That study is most likely worthless. I agree with Janice, from what statements are made on this site, it seems that most people believe that we should follow the constitution. The constitution was written to protect the laws of the few when the many are wrong! Again follow the 2nd amendment and make it so that if someone wants to carry a gun, they have to have a back ground check, take classes on how to handle a weapon and last get a permit from the city or the state. Did anyone think of this? Would this make the scared, able to change their minds? Why is it, when guns are taken away for law abiding citizens, crimes with guns multiply and innocent people pay the price?

Facts- C.P.D. officers use to be able to retire if they worked 20 years and were over 50 years old. Not any more, starting this year, when an officer is hired, it is 25 years and over 55 years of age. (Police pensions have not been paid into for decades from the city thanks to Mayor Daley. That is the reason for the change!). C.P.D. never had unlimited sick days, it is based on how many years you worked, 3 working years for every 1 year injured. You get into some bad fights, you think that it is not enough! Now, the city keeps trying to give officers only 12 days for every year worked. Wait to see if an officer is thinking of the number of sick days they have when a fight breaks out! 49 officers hired this year, without new officers, eager to do police work, you get the service you deserve! Computers have been placed into police vehicles only a few years ago, and most do not work or the officer does not know how to work everything on it! There are less than 80 training officers for the street, that means training is a joke with C.P.D. and where are the huge dollars going that are suppose to be spent keeping us safe? I do not know the answer to that question.
One last note, I don't think Chicago will become the wild west if we are allowed to join the other 49 states but why does the government of Illinois think the 2nd admendment should not be followed and our civil rights should be violated?

If you do not want to carry a gun-don't! If you do not feel safer with law abiding citizens having the right to carry a gun then you must feel safer with just the criminals have guns.

First thing, I would blame the last Mayor for this mess before the C.P.D. Again 1/3 less Police out there, 011th District has the one of the highest number of officers due to the crime (11 is a hole), but those units our new Mayor reassigned were also patrolling 011. That equals 1/3 less officers patrolling 011.
Second, police cost the most of all city services in every location. But again, here in Chicago, tax payers are paying for 13500 officers but there are less than 9000 now and the number gets smaller every day. How can I put this... (tax payer pays for 60 gallons of gas but the city only pumps 40 gallons and who knows where the money goes for the 20 gallons you did not get).OK?
In the end, the people who voted in these idiots who did not pay into pensions for decades, gave their friends fat governments pensions, tore up airports in the middle of the night and started law suits using our taxes to fight the constitution to violate our own civil rights are the ones to blame! I hope everyone wakes up before it is to late and vote these idiots out.

Before we right off the westside, I would like to point out after I was forced out of Lincoln Park (cost and children) and moved my family to west Humboldt Park, my neighbors and I got together, joined neighborhood clubs (United Blocks Of West Humboldt Park etc.). Gangs, drug dealers and getto liquor stores ruled the area. We voted Division St. dry (no liquor sales), turned vacant lots into gardens and with the help of the 14th District police reclaimed a lot of the westside of the park. The government did not help us when we requested their assistance but now they notice us and this neighborhood has not been so safe in decades. We are not done yet, a way to go still but I believe Humboldt Park will be as beautiful and peaceful as Licoln Park soon.This can be accomplished even in east Garfield Park with good people to move in and help force the criminal out.

We use to be the Murder Capital of the USA, but now, not by a long shot. I tried to read the above listed study (got a headache). What I do know, police chiefs of towns where crime was going up fast and officers were being laid off (and did not want carry cancealed laws) changed their minds fast when crime dropped when their citizens could carry guns legally in there towns! Just read the facts of when Australia outlawed guns and then gun crimes went through the roof as only criminals had guns. I believe this also happened in the UK, but I am not sure. I have first hand knowledge, guns in the hands of law abiding citizens, scare criminals and crime goes down, this I will not debate.

Again, if you voted Democratic, you are part of the problem. Dem. Gov. Quinn states he will veto any concealed carry law that lands on his desk.

I do not like it, but I understand why police stations must close because Chicago is broke. Wake up Chicago, we pay taxes for 13500 police officers but there is less than 9000 working now! We need the concealed carry law due to the fact there is almost 1/3 less officers on the street and criminals are taking advantage of this.

Again thank you all for your support, talked to 14th District Commander L. Flores at 1422's beat meating last night, she stated 14th dist. will not change and that 12 will take the most of 13 and some other border districts will take some of 13. We are going to loose 3 districts and 2 areas, easy to close with over 3000 less officers to fill them! Let's see how mad everyone gets when schools and librarys start closing. They will be next on the chopping block seeing that we are 635 million in debt.
Did you know millions will be spent on low income housing east of Humboldt Park, on Armitage at St louis and now I hear TIF money for a chuch and rehab center at Homan and Division. Why is our tax dollar going for this and not to hire more police? Crime will get worse with more low income housing and rehab clinics and less officers patrolling the area.

If an officer stated there would be less cars patroling, he has first hand knowledge on the remapping. This is what will happen, if an area has less crime the beats get larger and there are less of them (like 16th dist.), but if the area has more crime, more beats (cars) and the size gets smaller( like 11th dist.). Now my best guess, because crime is down in 12,14 (a large part of 13th dist. was in 14th dist.-south of North Ave to Division St) and 18th districts (18th built two blocks from the east border of 13), that they will take the most of 13 with 11th district taking the least area. I know 14 and 18 are built to except a higher number officer than are assigned there now, how large 12 will be, you would have to look at how it is being built.

Officers patrol a beat and are not dispatched from a station.

I worked in the 13th district and I know for a fact that the station is an accident waiting to happen. The studies were done a while ago so they are not self serving.

Now let me point out one last fact. If the savings was only 100,000 like authorities stated, that means the savings could be used to hire 3 more police officers that could respond to calls. Yes that is correct, by keeping this useless station open, the area is more dangerous with 3 less officers on patrol looking out for our safety.

The city is broke, too many supervisors, not enough workers, way too many aldermen (50 for Chicago much larger, New York only has 6 if I am not wrong on this one) Ha Ha.You want to save money, lay off half the aldermen. City workers pensions have not been paid into for decades (wait untill we get taxed for that one) and yet we debate the closing of this station. There are a lot bigger problems down the road and I hope when half of the cities workers are laid off and city buildings closed like in Detroit you will understand where I came from on this issue.

Last thing, I promise. Did you read on everyblocks that politicians are about to spend over 10 million of our hard earned tax dollars to flood east Humboldt Park with low income housing? Where did they get the money for that, I wonder!

First I word like to say I am sorry to Anne. I was never was nasty, rude, scream at you(?) and only commented on statements you made. If you thought otherwise, I am sorry, for that was not my intent.
Now back to more of your information, the authorities you talked to did they back up there statements with fact? Can they show the public these fact?
You stated I was wrong on every point, so let us go point to point.
1. Savings on closing the station would only be $100,000, it cost a lot more than that to maintain a building as old as this one. As I pointed out, one less commander and three less captains to pay. Go to the FOP Lodge 7 web site, check current contract highest pay scale for just a D-1 patrol officer is $89,646 and a commander makes well over the $100,000. in savings that the authorities stated. Now add in the three less captains and your talking huge money.
2. 1000 people disagree with me. Do these people know that there is now less than 10,000 officers on the job now and they all do not work the street. Did they start a petition demanding the city hire police to return the number to over 13,000 that they are budgeted for. Yeah you read that right, we are paying taxes for 13,000 police but there is less than 10,000. Where is the money going???
Maybe that is a little more important.
3.Will not be able to easily reach the police. Like I pointed out, there use to be over 100 police stations, now just 25 and if there was only 20, you would dail 911 and just as easily reach an officer.
I could go on about facts that everyone can look up on their own and not what I was told to believe by authorities but I will not.

What makes up "100 patrols" and how many officers are assigned to 13th District and more important, how many of them actually work there (some are detailed out) . There are times when there are less than 10 officers patroling the whole district. Where do you get your information from Anne??!!??

— On the neighbor message Don't Close District 13 Police Station
6:27 p.m.
I do not know where Anne is getting her information but she is wrong on many accounts and rumors that the station could become a homeless shelter is to scare people. Yes the officers that work their would like to stay for the most part but the building has no central air, no showers, no workout room and what is the cost of an officers safety (life and death). The cost to make the 13th District Station safe and up to date would be over whelming. Just think, one less commander and three less captians and no building maintance staff would save huge money alone. Even in these times the ground is worth big dollars too and if put up for sale, would go fast. The street officer would not be sent to the southside (50% PLEASE!!!), the districts that would replace the 13th District would get the officers for the larger area. Most likely the same officers that patrol it now would still patrol the same area in the new districts. Remember, two studies that cost the tax payer an arm nad a leg concluded "CLOSE THE 13TH DISTRICT STATION" and this was for the safety of the citizens living there! If the station closes (most likely) there will be no destabilization of the East Village, West Town or Ukrainian Village but would help because aldermen would not have tight control of the district. Again the officers safety is more important than an out of date station to me and should be to Anne too.

Please to not get mad at me for telling the truth, the station will not protect citizens, the officers do. The 13th District station is a danger to the officers who work in it. It is too old and costly to keep open. Not enough parking, lockers, no lock-up or even a court room, only one interview room that is so small, officers trip over each other with arretees that can reach over and touch the officer as paper work is being completed. Yes it would be nice to have a station on every corner but, two costly studies were done and both concluded that 13th district should be closed. Officers are at risk in this station with very little man power which means no back up for the officers who work there. The station should be closed for the safety of the officers. The brand new stations (much safer for police) around 13 will just expand their boarders and there will be more officers to patrol the area and back each other up. Please stop in at the 13th District Station, ask to see the working conditions their, and then ask yourself "would you feel safe working there"? I worry more about the officers than the station.

It is down but not out at all. Humboldt Park is springing to life again. Those prostitutes and junkies were the norm for decades and lived in the park, but now the park is free of them. Families have moved in and cleaned up the park. Gone are the dice throwers who also sold heroin on the side by joggers and dog walkers. I have seen the broken down buildings get rehabbed and good families move in and they go to the park and enjoy everything it has to offer. The gang bangers who ruined the park are gone for good and I have no doubt that soon all of the condos at 2800 w North Ave will be sold to the new families of Humboldt Park and the bad history of the park will be forgotten.

I moved here because of how beautiful Humboldt park is.The area and park have changed greatly over the years for the better and I am so tired of every time I tell people where I live, the reply is (gang banger park or how do you live in such a dangerous place or some reference to guns). My neighbors and I now help clean the park on clean and green day, started a community gardens and voted Division St. dry which as drove most of the gang bangers away. It just drives me nuts when the papers report another killing as happening in Humboldt Park, (the demographic location) but miles from the park itself. The day of the gang bangers in the park are over but this press makes it seem that the park is bad news.

First, there use to be a HUGH gang presence in Humboldt Park, but that presence has been getting smaller with every year that passes. I believe this is because the gang bangers are moving out, neighbors are working together and with police, families who care about their neighborhood are moving in and now Humboldt Park is a place that families want to move into again. I have seen many houses with gang bangers aways on the porches get foreclosed and then rehabbed with a great family move in. This is bring Humboldt Park back to life. The police can not clean up an area, it is up to us who live here to do so. (Remember ther are 4000 less police out there, and the working police are over whelmed) I know the history of Humboldt Park and it is HISTORY, I am concerned with what I see happening now. I have seen the dead gang bangers after the shooting when they no longer live in the neighborhood but only returned during the PR fest year after year and wonder when it will stop. I do not blame the fest for the killings, nor do I want to see a family fest closed down, but something must be done to stop this rise in violence that follows the PR fest.

The U.S. Government describes Lopez Rivera as one of the leaders of the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN), a Puerto Rican Nationalist group linked to more than 100 bombings and five deaths in the 1970s. Lopez Rivera will neither confirm nor deny his affiliation with the FALN and disowns any personal involvement in the bombing deaths.

At his trial 1980-81, Lopez and the other Chicago-based FALN comrades were not tied to specific bombings. Instead, he was convicted of seditious conspiracy ("attempt to overthrow the government of the United States in Puerto Rico by force"), armed robbery, and lesser offenses.Declaring his status as a prisoner of war, he refused to participate in the proceedings.

None of the bombings of which they were convicted resulted in deaths or injuries. Lopez Rivera was given a 70-year federal sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Among the other convicted Puerto Rican nationalists there were sentences of as long as 90 years in Federal prisons for offenses including sedition, possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a crime. None of those granted clemency were convicted in any of the actual bombings. Rather, they had been convicted on a variety of charges ranging from bomb making and conspiracy to armed robbery and firearms violations.They were all convicted for sedition, the act of attempting to overthrow the Government of the United States in Puerto Rico by force.

On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton extended an offer of clemency to 14 of the Puerto Rican political prisoners convicted on February 18, 1981. Lopez Rivera refused the clemency offer. Twelve accepted the offers and were subsequently released.

MARTA, I am not making any political stance either, but my daughter has been told several times to (MOVE OUT YUPPIE) by bangers on my own front porch during the pr fest. I have been to many fests in chicago and have not seen the crime, ie. shootings, gang fights and drinking on the streets like what occurs at the PR fest.I have personally witnessed with my children, a person beaten with a flag pole by bangers on North ave. just west of Kedzie. If this fest can not be made safe for everyone, than yes it should be shut down like the south side Irish fest was for just drinking and urinating. This is the only fest that I know that brings back bangers that have moved away years ago to shoot it out like it is old times again. The fest itself has police at every entry point and is supposed to be dry (PLEASE), unfortunately those of us who love humboldt park and moved in within a few blocks of it are left to defend ourselves and pleas to city officials and police have been unheard. So yes, it is cool to move into this area, just have to beware what happens friday and saturday nights during the PR fest. I will post pictures if you need proof of what I say if you wish.

THIS STORE IS UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT, BEFORE THE STORE WAS A HANGOUT FOR BANGERS AND OTHER BAD NEWS SUBJECTS ON THE CORNER. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOW CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.

THE BEST DISCRIPTION IS BEST FOR A POLICE REPORT AND IT IS ALSO NEEDED IN THE COMPLAINT(WORDING OF THE LAW). THE CHARGE IS THE SAME EITHER WAY. I THINK IT IS SO GOVERNMENT KNOWS WHAT IS THE DRUG OF CHOICE.
