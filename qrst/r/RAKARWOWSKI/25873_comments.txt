Time to move West with the rest of the population. Humboldt Park welcomes all new comers and their businesses that they own. Time to buy in Humboldt Park and invest here before the area is hit with these insane tax increases!

Some people thought a couple of criminals made off with items belonging to the garden and it had to deal with the loss. The fact is, the lots were sold to the developer building the two buildings on the two lots South of the garden. It appears that two more building will go up soon. The garden has moved to 3225 W Cortez and will start again to help clean up the neighborhood and make it a great place to raise a family. If you want to learn more about the garden and criminals in the neighborhood, please attend The United Blocks of Humboldt Park meeting on April 7th at 7 P.M. at Association House located at 1116 n Kedzie Ave.

The news and politicians support anti-police lives matter groups and so does a lot of loud mouth people, and now everyone wonders why Chicago is become murder city? Don't charge police with murder when they shoot a drug crazed criminal avoiding arrest with a knife. Maybe this surge in death would not be happening. CCW now rules the day so sad to say.

Al has a Facebook page but he has already removed the gang pictures. He does not own property, his Polish girlfriend does. I just saw a listing for a single family home on the 1800 N block of Talman asking for around 800K, Al will be moving soon enough so write that on a wall of The Bloomingdale Trail. He is a banger, NOT RETIRED, he said so himself above. He will have the same fate of all the other bangers of HP, death (a meaningless one), jail or move away. As pointed out above, crime is way down in HP from Al's bad out days and even with this crime wave, it is NOWHERE near what it use to be. It never will with every million dollar house built in HP. Most of these shooting happened in WEST Humboldt Park, West of Central Park and little to no shootings in the park itself! So I say, BYE-BYE bangers, so glad to see you go!

Msk, Why can't you understand what you read? United Blocks dropped West in it's name because of the large group that took that name and that area as their area of responsibility and are now calling it their neighborhood. United Blocks did not tell them to take that name to separate unwanted people! They made that name for themselves to better that area and have done a great job! Drive west on Chicago Ave from Kedzie and see all the work they have accomplished and their banners along the rebuilt street. So stop spreading your agenda to make it look like I am behind what huge neighborhood groups have done with no assistance from me! If you are all for change like you write, then embrace the new neighborhood association there, and give them the thanks for all the work they have accomplished cleaning up their neighborhood. I will continue to work with my neighbors in our neighborhood to do the same.

Let me add the Democrats that vote for these same corrupt Democrats because all Republicans are evil. Time for voters to wake up and vote for what is best for Chicago and not only for what is best for Democrats only.

BB, you call me names because you have no facts to make your case. You continue to try to label me and go off topic. Do you read EB news and posts? They report crimes and neighbors communicate to each other and work together to make their neighborhood safe. Reporting anything happening in a certain neighborhood, gives the people power over what is going on where they live. Yes, lost dog, I need a plumber, but those posts are only a fraction to crime reports. Just because I am old and I drink Fat Tire when I can does not mean I still can't help my neighbors continue to clean up our neighborhood. You and Al are better than me on one thing, I can not tell the race of someone by reading their posts or title given. The two of you seem to have that one in the bag. Only the two of you are associating "good" with white, and "bad" with minority" and hateful things toward yuppies "whites". I don't know or care what color EBer's are, only that we are working together toward the same goal, a peaceful neighborhood and a great place to raise a family.

People working to clean up their neighborhood on EB, they must be 80 - 90% white. Your words not mine. " Everyblock is another tool for white folks in the city."????? The only people that want their neighborhood to be over run by bangers and violence is Al and his couple of supporters here on EB! The rest must be white? Are you saying only "white folks" support law and order on EB? Do we not read the banger point of view on EB? Maybe you would have more criminals on EB if they did not continue to get removed for threatening law abiding citizens with violence and death. You know, remove yuppies "white folk" in body bags and burn their homes. I think a lot of people of color would disagree with you here on EB.

The girl I talk to thought she was living the good life. Her words, not mine. Section 8 is out of control like so many other government give a ways, started with the best of intentions but now so full of corruption. I have no idea where to start to fix it, so sad for all.

"Police are not the ones doing the shootings that have occurred recently around George and Albany", okay I will bite, what does that mean? Where do police do shootings? Watch the new today, 83% jump in shootings in Chicago! A huge drop in street stops by police since the CPD Officer was charged with murder after shooting a criminal armed with a knife, using the weapon to stop from being arrested! Your right, this has nothing with the crime that is affecting you here. I just can't put two and two together. I think I am wasting my time here, good luck solving your problem.

You keep saying it is my agenda. You make it seem like I alone want to change the borders. Please slowly read what I have written, The West Humboldt Park group, organized and claimed that area, not me. I can live with the couple of you here that disagree with community groups that have gathered together to clearly define their neighborhoods to better work on clean them up. Trying to exclude neighbors to the West or anywhere for that matter can not be farther from the truth. In fact, it is neighbors working together, taking responsibility for their close knit communities and making them a great place to raise a family again. That is the entire point of a well defined border where their work is being consecrated on. You are right on one thing, I do not have the power to redraw neighborhood lines, but my neighbors and I do. Most Chicagoans agree that it is the neighbors of any neighborhood who decide the borders. Not just you and the couple of others that agree with you here. I suggest you attend several different community meetings like I have and start working with them instead of against people attempting to better their neighborhoods.

The baby boom occurred because prosperity not the availability of section 8 housing! People were fruitful and multiplied because they could afford too. Years ago, I had talked to a teenager holding her baby in Cabrini, telling me how proud she was that her child was the 5th generation living in Cabrini and never wanted to leave. She then introduced me to her Mother, Grand Mother and Great Grand Mother all approximately 12 years of age apart. What lesson can be learned from that encounter, I leave to the readers here to decide. Do you think they chose welfare over not having a child for the pay check that came with it? I have three children and my wife and I did without for years to support them and never needed welfare. I had family, and they supported me and my family and that made us what we are today.

I did not rename the area, The West Humboldt Park Community group did. The area, my neighbors and I worked hard on to clean up is not by any means small. You can say the whole city is our community but my neighbors and I can not make it all safe! City maps are useless, go by what the people who live in that area say. Humboldt Park used to be a sewer and it is now becoming a great place to raise a family again and enjoy the park. All crime has been extremely lowered in HP because of everyone's work here, yet with a bold print headline naming the park as where the violence wrongly occurred sets us back ten years and continues the lie that the park is a dangerous place. I will continue my work to stop the news from portraying the park in such a poor light by reporting crimes that occurred miles away as happening in the park!

Are you confused enough now? Most of my Humboldt Park neighbors place the park in the center of Humboldt Park and the borders approximately four blocks away from every border of the park except to the north because of The Bloomingdale Trail. So, on the East, Western Ave.- on the North Bloomingdale Ave.,- on the West, Central Park and Grand Ave.,-on the South, Chicago Ave.. This places Humboldt Park (the park) in the center of Humboldt Park (the area) to railroad tracks which have always been barrier to neighborhoods. This makes the most sense to all my neighbors I have talked to. The people who disagree with this are people who don't live in Humboldt Park so I take their criticism lightly.

Nice to see you know The West Humboldt Park Development Council. They are doing wonders and should be congratulated for their efforts. I am glad to be of help. The block club West of HP was called The United Blocks of West Humboldt Park until the confusion of the new groups name of The West Humboldt Park Development Council. So a vote was made by it's members to change the block clubs name to The United Blocks of Humboldt Park so not to be considered members of the other group. Also, we are proud of our neighborhood around the park and calling the East side, West Bucktown or West Wicker Park does not do us justice. Humboldt Park is beautiful again, and we all should be proud we live here and not ashamed to say so, even as news faultlessly reports crimes as occurring in the park when they happen miles away.

ElizP, if you travel West on Chicago from Kedzie, you will notice a lot of street and business improvements, also banners stating the area as West Humboldt Park. A new neighborhood/business association was started over there a few years ago calling themselves West HP association. They have taken charge of the area South of Grand and have made great strides in the neighborhood. Hopefully this will clear any confusion and how crimes can be more accurately reported as to the location where they happen instead of making it seem they all happen in the middle of the park.

The city map clearly shows that half of Humboldt Park 'East of Sacramento", is not even in Humboldt Park so I think it takes a little mind to follow it. It also shows that Humboldt Park goes as far West as Cicero and South as far as Kinzie. Kinzie and Cicero in Humboldt Park, you got to be soft to think that. Why don't some people understand times and boarders change, move forward and stop living in the past. A neighborhood is defined by the people who live in it and not property values. Change with the times, Humboldt Park is not the gang ridden hell hole it was just a few year ago, stop telling everyone that it still is to keep law abiding people away.

Al, they still hang out between the flags (see other thread on shooting in front of Alderman's office), but that will soon end also. Was it not you who called HP a "Yuppie Paradise"? I will agree with you that HP will NEVER completely gentrify but that is what makes HP better than Wicker Park and Buck Town. The criminals are moving out because they do not own and the law abiding property owners are enjoying the benefits of their hard work. DIVERSITY makes HP beautiful and not just one group ruling over the park. All of us that invested into HP when everyone else said it was a gang banging hell hole can now rejoice as your time is ending. HP now attracts investors and new businesses and no bangers are going to stop it. A property on your block was listed for over 700K and now is off the market, I can only assume it was sold in less that a month. Do you think bangers will now pay the garbage can tax along with the higher rents? I don't see it happening, only them moving out.

From what I saw on the DNA map was that MOST say Humboldt Park ends at Central Park, placing this shooting in an area now known as West Humboldt Park. West HP has it's own associations that chose that name and are working on cleaning up that neighborhood. If the press would use the proper areas name, reports of violent crime occurring in Humboldt Park would drop by 90%! Humboldt Park is no longer the shooting gallery it once was and it is sad that the press keeps giving it such a bad reputation that it no longer deserves!

I have raised my family here at Division and Kedzie and it has been a long road but it is so much better than it was when we first moved in over a decade ago, there is no way to describe it. In June there is an event and gangs from miles away come and drive around the park, that weekend is horrible. After that, the gangs pretty much vanish and the true beauty of Humboldt Park can be enjoyed in peace. Thomas is a nice block but is located in the 011th CPD District which is very busy South of Grand Ave..I believe HP is again a great place to raise a family and will only get better with you and all the other new people moving in every day. Welcome, it would be great to be your neighbor.

Tenants frequently use the security deposit as a way to get two months rent back after having been evicted for not paying their rent and get it in housing court.

— On the neighbor message 606 Trail
8:28 a.m.
@TT, I will have to agree with others here that you just don't get it. A security deposit was used to discourage a tenant from leaving a apartment in worse of a condition then when they moved in. The tenant would get their money back if no cost in repairing the unit was passed on to the owner. Now that same security deposit is use to screw the Landlord if the tenant gets a hair up their rear end. Politicians thought this one up so tenants can screw their Landlord for any BS reason, thus anti-owner. I give my tenants a choice between the two and most tenants choose the move in fee so why is this so mind boggling to only you? I don't care what you do with your tenants so why do you call the rest of us greedy with how we deal with ours? Again, I think that after getting ordered into housing court a few times, you will think differently, and from what you wrote about what you do, it will happen very soon.

— On the neighbor message Apartment 4 Rent

@TT, that is not what you wrote how you handle your tenants security deposits. Greed has nothing to do with not taking a security deposit and you must have the perfect tenant screening process. I have had tenants pass my hard screening process only to cost me big dollars for no mistake on my part but because they used Chicago laws to screw the landlord. Just because they could! I am so happy I had insurance. Also correct me if I am wrong, but a 1099 is not required for earnings under a few dollars? A security deposit is now used as a means of screwing a landlord so don't call us greedy if we want to protect ourselves from this attack.

— On the neighbor message Apartment 4 Rent
6:32 p.m.
TT, I disagree. It is the politicians that force Landlords to use move in fees and not greed. If what you write is what you are doing with your tenants security deposit, when you get forced into housing court, you will wish you used move in fee instead. Hope your tenants are not reading this or you will find out the hard way.

That location is going through the roof and will be very expensive soon. On the other hand, notice the row houses down the street and taking up entire blocks on the surrounding blocks? They are low income projects and house the majority of the gangs in the area. They have been changing their rules to live in these projects and having the police come over several times is now grounds for eviction which is forcing the gangs out. It is a work in progress, now it is up to you to decide if it is worth it. The park is beautiful, The Bloomingdale Trail is out of this world and I have raised my family here, all totally worth it.

All two of them? You obviously don't know the definition of a gang. I have seen the old timers, hobbling along the sidewalk, not scaring anyone. You credibility was never good to begin with and your claims only prove how far from the truth you really are. Again the areas you name are not anywhere close to being a gang nightmare as it would be if gang numbers had grown by 10 fold. The last true gang cesspool is Englewood but due to the population drop in that neighborhood, I would say gangs are down 10 fold.

I on the other hand can give address after address of buildings that use to house the worst gangs in Humboldt Park and have been rehabbed and are now highly sought after by the new law abiding people moving in.

ll74, still not answering my questions I see. I know you can't because it will show your true colors, just like BB will not either. Do you read what you write? At what expense? The majority of people living in Humboldt Park over a decade ago were poor. Now the property owners who knew how to save, manage and invest their money are seeing the pay off of buying in Humboldt Park when no one else would. Building a better community made a lot of poor people rich. They now sell and move to a better neighborhood than what Humboldt park was when they purchased, The American Dream. Your lawn analogy is flawed, if I took care of your lawn, what would you learn? If I told you how to take care of your lawn, you would tell me I have no right to dictate to you how to live. How many of your neighbors lawns do you take care of? Again, Humboldt Park has the HIGHEST concentration of low income housing than ANY OTHER community in Chicago. They will NEVER be PUSHED out!

As for poor people fleeing, Humboldt Park has the highest concentration of low income housing than any other community in Chicago! They are not going anywhere! This is what makes Humboldt Park the best community in Chicago! No one group rules over the park and tells everyone else what to do. No segregation as in most other neighborhoods and we get along.

RR, sarcasm escapes me at times, so thank you for explaining it to me. The building in this post needs a lot more than just some TLC, as the seller points out in the listing. The way I read it, it should be condemned. I have done exactly to my building as you are doing to yours. You, along with developers, is just what Humboldt Park needs to become a vibrant community again. There is plenty of room for both in Humboldt park without a doubt. I am glad to have you as a neighbor. I also don't see what others see in these new stack boxes they are building, but they are selling big time, so I am out of touch with this taste also. Set for life in my book, is just what you wrote. You were able to buy as prices are rising out of reach. You now own, what others will pay twice or three times as much to possess. As the cost of living goes up, you will pass that cost onto your tenant. The cost of insurance and property taxes are no longer a worry for you. When it comes to your living conditions, the only worry you should have is to keep investing into your property so you will attract the high rent paying tenant. For every dollar you invest into your building, you will probably make five to ten in return. You are set for life, not quitting work and eating bon bons all day, but set for life all the same. 
Just to let you know, UR is most likely Sydney. This is one of the extremely few times Sydney has ever asked a civil question so I answered Sydney's question also in this post.

ll74, you have not answered my questions but I have answered yours. "do as I say but not as I do", is how you behave, shame on you. Do you not remember just a decade ago what Humboldt Park was like, gangs, drugs, violence and death? Crime was everywhere because because criminals lived here, cheap dumps to live in and no one called the police because of fear or they just did not care! If you can't manage your money, it is not my job to do so. We live in a Capitalistic society and yes green is high on the list, if you do not like this, move out of the country. By the way, when I purchased my property, there was no lawns, only weeds and clay on the entire block. Now, the entire block has grass and beautiful flowers. It is nice that the new people who have moved in care about their lawns and property and the people who never cared have moved away. Are you like A.M. and want the gang bangers and criminals to stay in Humboldt Park and stop gentrification at any cost? If you call having parents that cared about my upbringing, "privileged institutional", than I am guilty of that.

Now let's get back to the point of this thread. On another thread, about people fleeing Illinois for the last seven years, an EBer pointed out how single family homes are replacing multi units in Humboldt park, decreasing the population. Another EBer requested the source of this information and none was offered.

I can no longer find that thread so I started this one, posting what I found listed for sale next to the trail. I will repeat myself again, I want to see all of the criminals and gang bangers moved out of Humboldt Park and I don't care what race they are, I want to see more home ownership and I don't care what race they are! This is why HP is coming back to life in such a huge way so please stop using the race card when this has nothing to do with the race of law abiding citizens.

My neighbors of color own their property, so they are not going anywhere unless they want to cash out big time. This was one of the major reasons I moved my family here and it will not change in my life time. Except for the gangs leaving. HP needs more property owners and less renters that don't care about the neighborhood because they can move at any time. Multi cultural community is the greatest thing about Humboldt Park and not only one culture ruling over the park.

Glenn has a point, and I agree, Chicago is in trouble as long as these Democrats keep raising taxes to pay bills and fill the pockets of their friends! Now as for Humboldt Park, The Bloomingdale Trail is proof how if tax payer money is spend wisely, in a neighborhood in desperate need of resources it can come back to life. Now where violent crime, vacant buildings and lots use to be, development returns, earning badly need property taxes, with people who know how to build wealth instead of wasting it and demanding more from the government. The Bloomingdale Trail, like the Gold Coast, will make Humboldt park weather any problem the economy might have! All the million dollar homes and sky scrapers being built by developers around it is proof of that!

I will try to find the new story on developers now building million dollar plus, single family homes along The Bloomingdale Trail. It was out just a few days ago, so it is not BS propaganda. There are several expensive town home projects sold out within a block of The Bloomingdale Trail where vacant lots use to be! More than enough proof of the area changing without a source and an indicator of who is moving in. Al, what " militant means to stop gentrification" are you willing to do? Sounds like a threat to me.

BI, I am going to wait until I have learned all I can before I make that decision. I was leaning toward Bernie also until his remakes about CPD when he stopped here. 
Correct, I have earned my pension but now it is in jeopardy because Democrats are bankrupting the city! No Republicans to blame in City Hall or I would blame them to. Kool-aide drinkers keep voting (or not voting) the same corrupt politicians back into office! CPD never has benefited a lot by that corruption! Did you know that CPD does not have a union and it is against Federal law to strike or have a union? I remember getting a half of a percent raise one year and many officers pay checks went down because of it! So no union to fight like hell for anything, we begged the last Mayor for the tokens he would let us have and now it looks like he took our pension money with him when he left! Why do voters still back Democrats in Chicago when they took everything they could, bankrupt the city, closed schools, police stations and library's? Hell, they vote in dead and indicted politicians, no term limits, no ethics laws, many have family members as Judges and Lawyers in the Cook Co. courts so no worries about being arrested or even prosecuted. An Alderman's wife sits on the Illinois Supreme Court, what do you think she does for her party? I am going to vomit now, later.

Your not the first to paint me with that brush, shame on you. I am trying to get you and the rest of the kool-aide drinkers here to start thinking! A Republican can not fix this mess you Democrats have made here in Chicago, but getting just one to run will be an eye opening experience to them. That might make them think that it is time to listen to the people of Chicago instead of dictating to them how the city should be run. I never wrote elect a Republican, and they can be just as bad when there are no term limits to stop Chicago kind of corruption. Again a closed mind is a terrible waste and I will vote for the best person for the job instead of what a party tells me who to vote for. Good luck to you and the future you make for yourself.

Chicago's population was growing before and the weather was the same! The difference now is the bills are due and it is time to pay the piper! Our last Mayor knew how to sell off all of Chicago's assets and kick the bills down to the next Mayor as he runs away with all of the tax payers money. People call Rahm a Republican because his is attempting to balance Chicago budget, so to be a good Democrat, you must tax and over spend BILLIONS! To be an EVIL Republican, all you have to do is push for a balanced budget that spends less than taxes take in? Just keep drinking the kool-aide and voting for these Democrats just like in Detroit!

Chicago is the most segregated city in America but Humboldt Park is not and that is what makes HP the best neighborhood to live in.

SC, the two single family homes on Kedzie between Division and Crystal are being build by the same developer. The building to the North with the fancy curves, the developer will live in and the other will be sold. Every time I talk to him, the price goes up on the one to be sold, and he said both were supposed to be finished by the end of the year. Workers show up only a few times a week so your guess is as good as mine as to when they will be completed. I don't know what you mean by "party garage". If you mean the one at 3214 W. Division, the owner has been working on it for four years and I can not figure what he is doing. I think that it is the signs of the times, that all the vacant lots are finally being developed with mega single family homes.

A guy wacked out on PCP threatening people in a BK with a knife, no police, just you! I wonder how any of you would deal with him? This has nothing to do with race, if he were white, the officer would have done the same thing following his training in a high stress and life threatening incident.

A lot of questions to answer. First, you think when blacks kill blacks they go to jail for life, your on PCP! There is a spike in murders in black neighborhoods now that police do nothing there or completely avoid the areas! Black lives matter scaring the police is why blacks are killing each other more than ever right now and get away with it.Do you not watch the new on it? 80 minuets of video missing from BK, THINK!!! That means for over 80 minuets the police tried to arrest this guy without using deadly force prior to the ten seconds of video everyone here has convicted to officer by! Looks like a lot more needs to be learned before judgement. Reports stated he was waving a knife in a threatening manner, I saw that, most didn't????!!!?? He turned his head toward the officer and the officer fired, I saw that! The video is from behind so no one but the officers saw what he was doing with the knife at that very moment. So where does the false reports come into play? Police are trained that someone on PCP is extremely hard to stop, EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Now the knife gun, what the officer was thinking, why did he shoot him on the ground, only that officer can answer those questions. I have a question for all of you, if it was you or a loved one who was the officer attempting to stop this subject from injuring or killing others, how would you have handled it?

As for, "If you think that's tough to watch, try watching cop after cop walk scott free after executing your friends and loved ones", how many of your loved ones have police killed? I bet not one! Exactly how many citizens were killed by police who were not wacked on drugs, without a gun, knife or weapon of any kind, the number is extremely low in the last DECADE!!!!

It hurts when the press reports violent crimes that occur as far West as Cicero as if it happened right in the middle of the park we hold so dear. It is easier to change the boundaries than to stop the violence that happens non-stop on the West side.

Crime would drop tremendously in Humboldt Park if it ended at Central Park on the West. Many of my neighbors and I wish that the boundaries were changed to reflect that. Cicero is no where near Humboldt Park and crime that occurs there should not be reported as happening in the park! I can wish, can't I?

Yes, Humboldt Park still has a long way to go, but this is proof that we are moving in the right direction! Us who live here should all celebrate that we have made HP into a place that people with families want to live in again. Not so long ago, if you mentioned HP, the response was of shock and followed by "why would you live there?" I am so happy those days are ending quickly!

I for one look to the future of HP and am doing my best to forget this type of garbage from the past. This store has been more of a gang problem than it is worth and the community has been trying to close it for some time now. Shocking that criminals were able to close it in one night when the city and neighbors never could in years.

I just received more information on this, this banger is unreal! He was involved in an arson that killed a mother and her seven year old daughter! What are the details on his involvement are unclear but he is not in jail after he snitched on his fellow banger, so it must have been in deep. Yes, bad parenting and a choosing your special someone to have a life with is just the tip of the iceberg.

Fuarain, You didn't read the story when clicking on the link. Here, I cut the first lines so you could read it here,"Santigo, a documented gang member, purchased the gun that shot his son illegally. He has no Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) or concealed carry permit. According to States Attorney spokesperson Tandra Simonton, he purchased the gun for protection because he snitched on another gang member in a murder trial." So, in fact, you are wrong!

VPG, As CA is focusing on bad parenting in this thread, I focused on the gang-banger part of this thread. I never use "only" or that this only happens to gang-bangers. If this thread did not point out the gang relationship, I would not have brought it up. I just used this as another glaring reason that having anything to do with a gang-banger almost always ends up in death and/or destruction. I can't figure out why anyone would ignore the 800 Lb. gorilla staring them right in the face and focus on the smallest point of the thread? There are people that write that gangs are good for Humboldt Park and do not want them to be forced out by gentrification!! I am sorry that a child has died because of gang violence in HP, but glad we have one less gang-banger "former or otherwise" out of the neighborhood.

Okay, we have different views.

I read stories about gang bangers children get shot because their parents have guns and get into shoot outs on a daily basis but, because I use to be a police officer, I am to sensitive. OOOOOOOOOkay...

CA, former banger, why does he need a gun over the fridge? Pleaseeeee...... This thread is about gun violence and the former gang banger dad. So I limited my statement to it. Why would you not do the same? The news keeps telling the stories of children of gang bangers getting killed as the banger parent gets shot at! Hello!!! Why are the children not taken away from them for the safety of the children? How many more children must die before anyone stands up for their right to live in peace and have the ability to grow up? Children of child molesters are taken away from them to keep them from harm. What is the difference here?

"Carol Ann" YOU GOT IT!!!!! Now you totally agree with what I wrote, so why the thumbs down? Everyone who associates with gang bangers is at fault for any violence that occurs. If everyone ostracized gang bangers, there would be no gang bangers.
Fuarain, Your statement is so far out there, I don't know how to respond to it! How about you reread my statement "S L O W L Y" and address me on what I wrote and not what exploded in your head. If you live with a child molester, don't be surprised if your children are molested. The same can be said about living with a gang banger and the violence that surrounds them. If you stand with a gang banger on a corner at 2 A.M., don't cry if you get killed in a drive by.

Craig, I assume nothing, and base my findings on what has happened to Wicker Park, Buck Town and so on. How many gangs do you now see in those neighborhoods? As for needing cleaning, were you around HP in the 60's thru 90's? The placed needed massive cleaning, it was a war zone! You could have purchased three flat grey stones on the park for under a hundred thousand but no one wanted them. Where people do not call the police, you find gangs! Diversity, to me means different people with different economic levels, not to exclude the six figure income range, which we had none! The rest already have many safety nets but not the criminal. Last, the city is now finishing six, first time buyer homes in HP, on the West side of the park. I do not know how to find the requirements needed to buy one or where. You will have to search on your own, I would start at the Alderman's office.

When only counting the people that gentrification will force out of HP, I believe it will be 10 gang bangers forced out to every one good person that can not stay. Long term property owners as well as low income families that live in subsidized housing already have a safety net so they are not effected by property values. I don't count the property owners who now take the massive profit from selling there homes to live the American dream somewhere else. Gang bangers are not smart and don't prepare for economic change nor can they handle people moving in that call the police. They only prey on the weak and the defenseless and the new people moving in are not either! With property prices like these, bangers gotta go!!!

Craig, No, never wrote that only gangs will be forced out. Unfortunately, a few good people will also be priced out. I believe it will be 10 to 1, 10 being gangs to every one good family that it will happen to. "my son has told me that "Humboldt Park is the best place in the world to live," ", your son is correct! The neighborhood will stay diverse and of all income levels because of all the low income projects that flood HP. The politicians have done their best to wipe the middle class from HP but those who purchased in HP back when nobody wanted to, now reap the benefits of their hard labor. They should, don't you think? You would like to see the same thing happen where you are buying now right? Your not buying where the neighborhood is getting worst and you will lose money are you? Have you seen the East side of the park? It is almost all the very rich or the very poor and little to no middle class! On the West side of the park, we fought this from happening, stopped the flood of low income projects making up entire blocks, demanded affordable signal family homes and property ownership instead of mass rentals. I think we are the better side. There are six first time buyer homes just now being finished here and it sounds like you fit the requirements to purchase one. I would welcome you as a neighbor and your children could play with my Grandchildren. Now that would be great. WW, sorry you feel the way, Craig and I believe HP is the best place to put down roots and already have. I raised my children here and now they are raising their children here too.

Sounds and looks bad! This will give HP a bad reputation, but that is what they want. Destroy the park and gentrification will not happen. At park meeting last night, no pumpkins for pumpkin fest because no money. Another fest gone or cut to nothing. I pointed out that Riot Fest always donated money and pumpkin fest would go on but only one elderly women said don't need them. So screw the children so we can keep Riot Fest out, and the swimming pond, and the up grading to the park and bringing businesses back to the neighborhood, and.......

Every statement made here is the reason to vote Republican next time or a least get a Republican to run! Put the fear of being voted out in their heads instead of the uneducated Chicago voter will never vote Republican because of years of drinking our kool-aide! VOTE and they have to listen, DON'T, and you get used and ignored like we have in Chicago for DECADES! See what is happening in the Republican debates? Even Republicans are sick of these career politicians and are making their views clear for everyone to see. Chuy would have made things worst and taxed us even higher till we were Detroit!

"CA", stores target customers. That is why you don't see a Cermak down town and why NOW HP needs a Mariano's. 
How many American flags can you have displayed on one property?
I am a Vet, served my country with distinction! I display my pride in my country by displaying the American flag. I need to display more.
Rakarwowski can't hep (help) his racist views. Race has nothing to do with calling gang bangers scum and law abiding people good. You want senseless violence, you are scum! You want to help your neighbors make HP a peaceful place to raise a family, you are good. I don't see how that view is racist? O wait, I forgot who wrote that.
Now, Allen, what will be your property taxes in four years, how many times have you been arrested, are you a felon? You live in (hide in) a glass house, don't throw stones. You don't intimidate me! What do you think of my wife's flowers and fish pond. All my neighbors love them, take pictures and the preschool around the corner bring the children over to see the fish. My neighbor has done the same and her building is awesome. I am very proud of my building, everyone come stop by and see how hard I worked with my neighbors to clean up HP.

" Carol Ann", I have no problem with Cermak. I enjoy what they have to offer and been there several times. There are several, or close to it, around HP. I want a FULL SERVICE grocery store like I wrote, Strak n Van Til, Pete's fresh Produce or even a Mariano's. Why are we limited in the HP neighborhood? Why are we treated like second class citizens and not like East of Western. HP has changed so much and is so diverse that Cermak doesn't cut it any more. The last census around HP proves that the area has gentrified to the point that we deserve more diversity in places to shop. I don't understand why what I wrote was considered an attack, I only responded to BB's inconsiderate question in kind. Diversity is what makes HP the best place to raise a family from my point of view. Anyone replying to flood the area with only Cermak foods gets the response I gave. I don't like Jewel either any more, it use to be be good but not anymore. I am just tired of traveling East of Western to find what everyone else in Chicago expects in shops to find what they need. Why are we in HP treated this way? We work, have families, pay our taxes, want to live in peace but always seem to get the short end of the stick. I am sorry if anyone took what I wrote the wrong way. I only want the best for the HP area.

If you look at it that way, my family sold out their history when they moved to America and left Europe. Everyone who came to America did too. It is called progressing and if you don't change, history is your fate. Gangs love vacant lots weather they hang out or not and it is a sign that nobody wants to buy in that area. Abandoned vehicles, stripped and then burned was common place in the vacant lots around me till a few years ago. I understand you not wanting to give your address but why not a close major intersection or at least North of/ West of the park? If you don't want to, I will not press the issue.

My family always owned a multi unit building, so we were never affected by taxes. You want to own property and want to keep it? Just like any other money making business, you have to close if you do not make a profit. If you do not prepare for change, you become part of history. I never saw a 3.5 million dollar building being built West of Damen! BOOM, here it is, we all who now live here must prepare for the big change that is happening NOW!

I never wrote that the Republicans were not to blame down state but in Chicago (which started it all), only Democrats have been in charge for decades. Term limits, I say we only need ten Alderman and a code of ethics for City Hall would be extremely helpful. They should get no pensions! The best thing to ever happen to Illinois Constitution law or our Police and Fire workers would be screwed now. Now remember, Detroit went bankrupt and with that their police and fire are going to loose their pensions! Hope they are happy for voting Democratic! If Chicago voters would show that they will think before they vote, everything would change here. Do you think that could happen? Democratic politicians in Chicago don't and there is proof time and time again they have nothing to worry about. Without a Republican running in Chicago, we are lost.

So don't cry, you asked for it! One last note, pension reform is not the answer and the Illinois Supreme Court and the Illinois Constitution ordered that it can not be changed (thank the unions for that).

At the last beat meeting, it was brought up that there are a few gang families still on the 3300 W Blocks of Le Moyne and Beach. Gangs members are making their presents known because they are feeling the pressure of gentrification. Several arrests have been made and guns have been recovered as gun fire has increased as they try to stop law abiding people from moving in. Police state that because these gang members own property, it is much harder to make arrests and get them out of the neighborhood. Neighbors are asked to dial 911 and give an accurate description of gang members doing criminal activity. Police have stepped up patrols and this is the result. Thank You C.P.D..

I think the stores on Division Street with signs that read "NO RIOT FEST IN HUMBOLDT PARK" were the main target even though one had "SORRY" on it also. The bar on the 3000 West block of North Ave. was also named because the owner spoke out against RF with Charlie at a surprise park meeting.

I use to go to Division Street Bar and Grill until they had to close because all the gangs bangers from a few doors down the street chased away the customers. Now there is the Chinese place, that has been there forever and now the Mexican pizza joint across the street from the closed place I went to. It appears that the Mexican places are doing much better now and don't attract motorcycle gangs or bangers so they are probably best to go to. They also welcome everyone. Jen I knew you hang out there because you wrote your part of that scene. I hope one day everyone will be welcome there but until then, it's for Allen and his friends and others will continue to avoid the no mans land that haters have made it to be.

Back on topic, I like Wicker Park Fest. Great people don't have shoot out during it, in the middle of it, and if there is drugs (only one individual stated that), I didn't see it so I don't care. Hey, they didn't kill any grass either which makes it ggrrrrrrreat!!!

Seven years ago they stopped construction of the million dollar homes on the 1800 N. block of California because on one wanted in. Now The Bloomingdale Trail is open, all of the million dollar home are sold and gang activity is at it's lowest for decades! You write there is no difference? In what bubble are you living? There is construction every where, towers are going up at California and Milwaukee and you think it is the same as SEVEN YEARS AGO. Open your eyes, the bad old days are over and in a few years people will be talking about the only fest that still has shooting in HP like you show in your video links. You can't stop the change that is already here no matter what you write.

I don't need to take jabs at PR Fest, the gang bangers have that covered. I am old to you and 26 is a child to me so that explains your knowledge of the world.

Thanks HP Neighbor. Bush, if you have read my posts, I point out that gang violence spikes certain times every year in HP! Each year the violence is less as the gangs are forced out and good people move in. Do you remember what was on those six lots before gentrification started? It was two vacant lots and four abandoned stores. One was a butcher who left all the meat to spoil and the city had to clean it up with a HASMAT team! These buildings are a blessing to HP and proves that businesses are willing to invest here again. Prosperity has returned, we still have work ahead of us to clean HP but the job is getting easier with every good neighbor who moves in and helps out. Time to stop complaining about HP and start helping to make it a better place to raise a family again. HP is an amazing park, Welcome, I know you will enjoy it as much as I do.

Jen, I never mentioned PR Fest and you are the only one who wrote that this fest is full of drugs. I have been there and never saw that. Also to write this fest is as bad as a fest that has shoot outs during the parade and non-stop gang violence on Division as videos show, proves what you are doing. Can you show me a video of a shoot out at any other fest in Chicago, do you think that fest should be stopped? Why did anyone go there from my post? A friend invited me to go this year and I posted it. If anyone thinks this is a stab a PR Fest, that just shows how insecure they are about the violence that happens at that fest every year and try to make other events look bad so PR Fest doesn't appear as the worst!

It is also great because I know that it got to you and there is nothing you can do about it! How many banger friends did you loss from this building? How many doors down from where you live is it? Maybe next door! The new residents will be watching your every move and calling the police every time you do as you always have in the past. You have been band from EB how many times now? Do you feel the pressure to get out? Even EB is tired of you. Your property taxes are going to soar because of all the politicians stole every city workers pension money and these 900K$ buildings will raise your property value. No money for flipping buildings to rent to gang bangers! You are so gone but just don't know it yet! Bye-Bye banger, so happy to see you go!

Gang bangers are scum now, I don't care about history! Gangs do no good today and writing that there is some good in them is a waste of some ones life. I will agree it is better to help a banger out of a gang than lock them up but as you can read, some don't want out and only want to commit crimes! These violent acts have been happening around the area for about a month now! The description of the offenders has been the same in every case, a group of three male black teens mainly attacking white women! Now let us all be on the look out for these criminals, call the police quickly, give a accurate description and get them locked up before they violently attack a defenseless woman. How about we work together to do that to help clean up our neighborhood!

Read about it in the Red Eye, July 13, story title- Logan's Lingering Crime. I have seen this happen many times and after the spike in violence, (gang bangers kill each other and the survivors go to jail), peace is restored to the land and the bangers are gone.

My PR neighbors who own their property are not going anywhere as long as they want too. Many of those same law abiding PR home owners helped clean up HP and move the criminals out so they are also gentrifying the area.

Here we go again, Whites are evil....blah....blah....blah! This guy is truly the best representative for how HP was just a few years ago! Does anyone remember when the Polish-Americans were forced out by who is getting forced out now! He has no problems with that! I remember before gentrification came to HP, gangs ran the park, murder, shootings and body parts pulled from the lake! This individual believes those were the good times in HP. Now gentrification rears it's ugly head, gangs move out, crime rate drops dramatically, parks become accessible to families again, great fests happen in the park and The Bloomingdale Trail opens! He wants to stop this from happening because whites are the problem by moving in. Read who praise him in destroying what we all (HP residents) worked so hard to build. It was not only whites who made HP what it is today but all the law abiding neighbors who stood up to the criminals and stated together, WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS ANY MORE! See what beautiful things happen when we all work together for the common goal of peace. This individual, Charlie and the ones who support them want to divide this community and what better way than write WHITES ARE THE PROBLEM! Sounds like something stated by a German leader about Jews during WWII doesn't it? This is the hardest and most serious test for residents of HP in decades and I hope we can pass it with honors and not fall into the depths of division that these individuals want us too.

That did not happen here on this thread so why bring it up? We know the answer so please move on. EB allows neighbors to work together to make their community a better place to live. It also allows everyone to read what wack jobs write on both sides of the topic. Knowledge is power, and learning about gang banger thoughts along with their sympathizers will lead to ridding HP of their violence! Calling a gang banger scum shows others that they have neighbors who are not afraid of gangs or to call the police and have them arrested for their crimes. This frightens the krap out of them because they are truly cowards and fear the law abiding citizen who stands up to them most of all. Why do you think they all move away when an area gentrifies?

What would you call gang bangers who shoot and kill 7 year old children? Bangers are scum but the city is now working with the worst of them to guide them away from the killings and help them become good citizens again. 14000 criminals commit 70 to 80 % of all crimes in Chicago. The city is now working to assist them to get out of gangs before they become the next victim or some innocent child that may be around them during the next shooting. They all can't be helped but if only 20% are saved, think of all the innocent lives saved as well.

Downtown, they would be called theft mobs. My daughter saw a group of black males, between 11 and 16 years of age hiding among parked vehicles in the park the other day. She noticed one scream now, and the others jump up , throwing things at passing vehicles. They all then ran out of the park W/B. A woman was passing on a bike and one of them ran up to her and punched her in the head. She screamed "WHAT WAS THAT FOR?", and rode away as they ran away laughing! Hope this is not the start of West side violence happening in HP.

I find the racial attacks disturbing and not helpful to the topic at had. The majority of HP know what divided the community no matter what race we are and we together can fix it instead of joining in on what they started.

I learned that there was a lot of gang activity that night and every time police responded the bangers would flee like the low life's they are. Law abiding neighbors on those blocks are requested to dial 911 every time gangs gather. We can clean up HP if we work together to rid the neighborhood of gangs.

The three strike rule was put into place to take sentencing out of the hands of corrupt or inept judges. No fantasy land, just reality. For someone who has been locked up before, most of your posts come from fantasy land without a doubt! The story reports, he lived on the next block from you, do you know what gang he was in? Did he support others living with him that will have to leave the neighborhood because of lost income he provided? Your neighbors must be very happy that a gun pointing criminal has been removed from the area and make it better for the law abiding families to move in. There can be only so few criminals left living by you now that they are being watched by everyone else very closely. I am sure that someone is calling the police on them as soon as they even J-walk, as they must stick out like a sore thumb now. It is just getting better and better in HP every day and no matter what you write, you can not stop it now. One day, reality will sink in with you, till then, just keep counting the bangers being jailed and moving out because law abiding citizens will not put up with their garbage any longer! When you exit your house, do you feel like someone is watching you? I remember working in dangerous neighborhoods and everyone walked around spinning their heads to look out for violence around them!

Maybe, if he had only committed one felony, but it is reported he committed several felonies! He is most likely a felon already, so this would put him under the three strikes ruling. That means LIFE. Sucks to be him! Now let's just say he gets out in two years. That means, the neighborhood is better off and peaceful without him for two years. After that, he probably will not be able to return to the neighborhood because it will have changed so much faster with him gone. Either way, this criminal and bangers like him will only be a memory soon enough. Bye-Bye bangers, so happy to see you go.

I never knew how fantastic the homes were on the East end of the trail are and can not wait for the building boom to make it to the West end. Hats off to Rahm for taking an eye sore of an abandoned rail line use mostly by criminals to evade police and turn it into a park for families to enjoy in peace. This will definitely bring the neighborhoods together and back to life and a major blow to the criminal element and forcing them out of the area. I noticed that all access points are under video surveillance which will definitely keep law breakers thinking twice of doing anything stupid on the trail or use as an escape route.

Mister Real Estate is an Anti-Riot Fest hater and is trying to make gentrification look bad and blame RF for it. He is attempting to divide HP and stir up anger against the new people moving in.

I went and Maldonado repeated he was anti-Riot Fest because that is what the majority of the community wants. I asked if it was proven that the majority of the community wants Riot Fest would he change his mind, his reply was he would still be against Riot Fest! He also stated that Riot Fest organizers had not approached him since September but I saw Max there last week so he must have forgotten that. This appears to be a dead end.

There is no question also about all the jobs and economic development you will be destroying if you succeed in kicking RF out of HP! The only thing I am waiting for you to do is tell everyone the truth behind your community crushing agenda. You started these threads, now answer the question put to you for doing so.

If he had showed up at meetings and learned what RF is doing to address all of his concerns, we would not be here now. He just showed up one day and stated he wanted RF out of HP. Never asked anyone at the meeting for input and he is still wrong about half of what he is arguing about. When you don't know what you are talking about, refuse to listen to reason and take the stand "MY WAY, WHICH IS THE HIGHWAY ONLY" this is not a nice way to treat your neighbors. How can you care about the park but not be apart of meetings about the park? You want to help, be a voice of reason not a dictator, ordering HP residents to submit to way only! I believe if you do not listen to your neighbors on the HPAC and attend meetings, why should anyone listen to you about the welfare of the park!

RF has been at HPAC meetings months before every event, now four years in a row. Charlie has been at the last two HPAC meetings, never seen before in the last decade! If he cares about the park so much, why hasn't he been attending HPAC in the last ten years? I don't believe he cares about the park at all and this is just his way to stop gentrification.

I agree HP will never be all one race but that is exactly why it is the best place to raise a family. Diversity is what makes HP, HP! We have so many different cultures Living here, making their own American dream come true. The people who stayed in school, got a good job, saved money, purchased property and are law abiding live here. They are not leaving unless they want to! What do these people have in common? They want to live here in peace, no bangers shooting up the place and the ability to coexist! No one race can tell another to get out or stay out so let us keep working to make HP better than Lincoln Park in which ANY law abiding people can live.

This is how it was in HP over a decade ago. Remember how bad it WAS? Now we call people who call the police HEROES! It is only dangerous to the banger because us law abiding neighbors will not cower and hind from them any more! With every garbage store that get closed, it is one less hang out for bangers. We are all better for it.

It is unlawful for a building to be for TEACHERS ONLY. A restaurant not on a main street, not likely. This is just a way to keep this building and the area out of a developers hands and keep HP down. The city is broke and if the building was placed onto the open market and sold to the highest bidder, the city would make huge $$$$$$!!! That would also raise the the tax base so property taxes would not have to be raised.
