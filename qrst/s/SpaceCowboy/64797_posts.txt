Garbage

    Too bad you can't see it all... White cups, napkins, old food, and disposable food containers all over this area. I don't understand how this is acceptable. This is a park entrance. I am slightly disgusted every time I walk by this mess...

New Retail on Division and Kedzie?

What to do about stray cats?

    We now have 4 stray cats wandering around our part of the block (they are staying within a 4 home radius). One is pregnant for sure. Unfortunately, neighbors are feeding them, but, not taking care of them with Tags/Spading/Neutering. I feel like they will keep breeding and breeding, like rabbits. ...

PR Fest - Out Of Control

    Still going strong @ 10:50pm. Helicopters, police sirens, ambulance sirens, car horns, people yelling/screaming, public intoxication, infants still awake, speeding cars / motorcycles, fireworks, arrests, and gun shots. I don't understand why the city would fund such a violent, out of control event. Who is paying for all the law ...

    There is a 2-Flat next door to me, owner occupied. They recently had the whole back yard nicely done with concrete. During this process, they by-passed their (1) massive gutter from the sewer and ran a plastic 3-3/4" extension tube to run along our adjoining fence in our back yard. ...
