    One has to wonder how much hate and racism he has spread in his years as a professor.

Allen, as much I absolutely 100% disagree with nearly everything you say here, your ability to consistently troll these forums is 15-year old white kid in mom's basement level. You really are a master of the craft.

Space cowboy, I agree so much with Mr. Lopez, he is a true warrior and a hero to his people. I believe in his fight, and will aid him in any way that I can.

Through his "constituents" leading rants that certain people do not belong in HP. This was done on May 4th. Saw it with my own eyes and heard every word. The guy's a bigot.

Jose Lopez... who coincidentally lives in Bucktown, but doesn't complain about all the white people living around him there. He just, for some reason, publicly states he wants them all out of Humboldt Park. What a prick.

I must laugh out loud, people debating the detention of racism, without knowing the definition of racism! Racism is about power! Since when as any man or woman in this country black, brown, green, yellow or otherwise had power?! To argue that reverse racism is a thing...is the most novice of debates. I thought debunking reverse racism was something people learned freshman year of college? Saying the white people need to get out of hp doesn't make him a racist it makes him a dick. At the end of the day, you still get to be white, which is privilege in and of itself. Don't feel guilty about it accept it and move on. To be racist is to have power. The question is what you do with that power.

Yeah, I started reading her post and I wanted to flick the screen with my finger. Being a lifelong Chicagoan, I know exactly what racism is. Although, thank you Beth for taking from your very busy schedule to give me a lesson on something I was taught when I was 4. So sorry you had to wait til your freshman year to learn about it.

Beth, I respectfully disagree. By that definition the Socialist Worker Party in Germany could not be construed as having been racist in ideology until Hindenburg left in 1934 despite organizing the Beer Hall Putch in 1923. By your definition, Hitler was not racist when he wrote Mein Kampf in 1924 and before he gained a majority in the Bundesrat. Although the new rage in some classrooms nowadays is to treat racism as a power issue only (and thus insulate some groups from obvious racism, i.e., Farrakhan), that is a bastardization of the original term, perverting it from its original meaning. Historically speaking, groups could accede and be ousted from power within a matter days by another tribe or clan. The other clan would not be racist just because they won a battle.

The fact is any one, anywhere can hold a racist opinion and believe that one group is superior or inferior to the other.

I do agree that racism is inapt here. What you are talking about is an act of discrimination not a held belief. In this case, the Cowboy claims that he was actively discriminated against because of his status in the neighborhood. Discrimination being treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit.

Here Cowboy would be correct that the impact done by RF was treated differently than the impact by other Fests in the Park.

Hello Beth. Ever heard of Barack Obama? Cannot get more power than that!
You don't think that Prof Lopez has power? When he says jump, Maldonado says how high. Luis gets him a half million Stimulus dollars for his horse barn museum and he uses his Northeastern students to clean the toilets there for events. That's power.
I don't like the racism term because it is intellectually lazy. People use it when they lack the time or mental heft to argue their point. They also use the term to marginalize their opponents.
I'm sorry that your education dollars were wasted indoctrinating you with all that social justice drivel and failed to give you the ability to critically think without the dogma. Do you also think that a room full of white people is in itself a microaggression for people of color?

Not to mention Eric Holder was the Attorney General for 6 years. In case you don't know what the Attorney General does according to Google :

"In the federal government of the United States, the Attorney General is a member of the Cabinet and, as head of the Department of Justice, is the top law enforcement officer and lawyer for the government."

Eric Holder is also the lawyer that worked on the pardon case for the jailed Puerto Rican terrorists at the end of the Clinton administration. Luis pushed for their release too. Jose Lopez' brother would not make the deal because he would not promise to behave. Pressure is being placed on Obama to let Lopez go with no strings attached. That's what the posters up and down Division are all about.

Beth, I don't mean to be funny or hurtful, I just want to know in the most sincere of questions: Are you ingesting chemicals? I read your post and it is incoherent at best. To be bigoted is to single out someone based on race, creed, color, religion, sex, etc. I don't know if this gentlemen being discussed here is bigoted. I only 'know' him from the video clip form the other article but I do know what bigotry is though. I am in no way suggesting this gentlemen is bigoted as I don't know him, I am just stating the facts of being bigoted.

You may never have thought you'd see the day or you may think it's funny, but the U.S. Supreme Court is reversing affirmative actions across the country. Race is no longer relevant.

Carmen Valentin was my counselor when I went to Tuley. I would sit outside her office and listen to the hateful incindiary conversations she had with her P.R. students. Having been raised in H.P. most of my friends were Puerto Rican and Black. We all knew she was nothing but a trouble maker. If anyone thinks whites are the only ones capable of hate against people who are different, they are very sadly mistaken.

I really love Diana's. I fed 9 people for $40 at Feed on Friday. I like Archie's. I liked it when Patchwork Farms had market days. I like The Wasteshed which sells used art supplies.

It is amazing how incensed some Caucasians on this thread get about their perceptions of being discriminated against and judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their hearts. And, at the same time, showing absolutely no empathy for those whose whole lives have been effected by those phenomena. That is true privilege at work

Privilege? Sorry Mike, I am not going to agree with you there. Also, what empathy is to be shown? Sorry I moved to Humboldt Park?? Is that my empathy? Also, how am I effecting others around me? By making my property nice? By helping my neighbors? By cleaning up the park? By calling the police when activity is happening? Just by me moving to HP, am I making it harder for a resident that has been here their their whole life? Probably not. I mainly see affect in a positive matter... Let me assure you most people have their hearts are in the right place. They want a safe and beautiful place to live. Please tell me how this is negatively affecting the community. By raising Taxes? Well, that is not my fault. My taxes go up too. I am not a well to do individual, although, I am working hard to achieve that every day. I want my taxes to stay low...

This thread is mainly about Lopez. I heard, from his mouth directly, racist comments about white people on May 4th in front of the Ald's office. This guy is supposed to be someone the community looks up to? This is whom you want your kids to take advice from? The man that is trying to stop the White Barbarians from taking over HP? No one is taking over anything. People are selling in HP, and other people are buying.. Remember "White Flight"? Maybe there's a "PR Flight" happening right under our noses and we don't see it. Regardless, I haven't seen or heard of one person being pushed out of HP. People are selling their property, making top dollar, and moving on. Maybe they got tired of what HP used to be and needed a change.

Mike, your post makes me a little angry. You think White people can't be discriminated against? My wife has been called "White Bi***" more times than I want to admit... She didn't deserve nor earn that name, but she is used to it, which makes me mad. Sadly, it's underage kids, or a group of dudes that say this.... Both of which I try to avoid confrontation. I won't tell you of our dirty looks and ignorance when we go to Cermak Foods.. We stopped going there. I will gladly spend my money somewhere else.

Mike, I am a long time Chicagoan. I have lived in many parts of Chicago from Southside to Northside (born and raised). Don't talk to me about racism and privilege, I might be able to give you a lesson or tw

Get Real HP

In general I would agree with you, Mike. At the same time, I recall seeing a post on the anti-RF Facebook site where the poster indicated that all of the pro-RF people at the park district meeting a few weeks ago all were saying "we understand what you are saying" to the anti-RF people, and that they empathized, and the poster's response was how that "showed the cards" of the pro-RF crowd, and essentially that they did not believe in their cause like the anti-RF people. Someone else posted a response and soon thereafter the comments were deleted. The problem with this situation from my perspective is that the people whose lives have been affected by it have truly become bullies, and see empathy for those who disagree with their position as a sign of weakness. I don't like bullies, as I don't find the content of their character to be very high. I may empathize with how those who really have experienced it got that way, but it doesn't make it right. And I have much less empathy for those who pass on their issues with discrimination to their children, who may otherwise have a very different perspective but for what they are being taught.

I have never felt anything but comfortable at Cermak Market.
and, It has been close to 20 years since I found myself in and uncomfortable or confrontational situation in HP [outside politics :) ]

But I do get that these are complicated and emotional issues.
And that folks tend to seem more extreme and onesided on EB than they are likely in person.

I have never felt uncomfortable in any establishment. I have to admit I have seen so many gang fights and shootings, there are times I am uncomfortable on the street if the bangers are out. You never know when something horrible can happen. I love Cermak. It is my new favorite grocery store next to Capputtos. I have shopped there since it was Del Farm. Never ever a problem.

Mike -

I have agreed with much of what you have said throughout this mess. But I have to ask about your most recent comments. Do you have something to gain from diminishing people's personal experiences, or is it just something you do for fun? Everyone experiences different things, especially in a large city like Chicago. So no one has ever treated you badly, thats terrific! I wish I could say the same. It doesn't give you the right to come on here calling out privileges. It seems the one person on here with real "privilege" is you. Please think on that before diminishing others.

With respect and love.

It is not something I have been aware of a very long time (I spent most of my life thinking this was more excuse than anything else); but I truly believe that most of us with any sort of privilege have no way to see or appreciate it. Rich privilege exists. Male privilege exists. Privilege of dominate culture.

it is not my intention to disrespect anyone's experience & reality- including gang members, those threatened by gentrification, and those adversely effected by those resentful of non-Puerto Ricans in HP.

As an upper middleclass white man- I enjoy a lot of privilege.
What privileges do YOU enjoy?

Mike Mike Mike, I respectfully disagree with your comment regarding white privilege. I can use myself as an example being the daughter Of immigrants. Nothing was given to me. If it was offered , my father would forbid any type of charity. We could not even Trick or treat as he said it was "door to door begging. What about the millions of white children documented as being below the poverty line. White children go hungry also. If I had any privilege it would be the privilege of being raised by parents that cared enough to discipline me, force me to study, be honest and humble, and have a strong work ethic. Other than that there has been no privilege or entitlements in my life.

Very few people are never discriminated against. And very few are privileged in all circumstances. To think that one never gets/has privilege, is to assume entitlement for all that you do have. We are all given Gifts. Grace, if you think in those terms. A sense of entitlement is the opposite of a sense of gratitude, I am thinking. We are much better off with a sense of gratitude.
