    Wait til that new FIRST PUBLIC Self Sustaining Beach is constructed in the park... That will be the final nail in the old HP stigma. I guarantee it's going to be big news in Chicago once construction starts. People are going to flock to this area for this one reason only... The 606 will be a secondary attraction.

    White Privilege on this site? Please explain to me how you can see this. I've yet to see a post that is "Whites only". I also fail to see how you even know who's white and who's not.. You have a problem with white people? Why don't you go find an anti-whitey site to get your fix. Don't bring your hateful trash to EB.

    jeebus Rogerparker, "Assessments will rise and no will be safe not even the elderly." Sounds like Vikings are coming to attack the city. Agreed, assessments will be high... Unit costs will be high... It is obviously geared toward the the Chicago Professional, which there are many. Lots of these folks work downtown and make a pretty good dollar to pay for the lifestyle.. Most are not having kids and living a single lifestyle as well. This is a trend right now and there's not much anyone can do about it.

    Plus, I see a trend of long time city folk moving to the burbs and younger folk moving in to the city. I know the city is always in transition, but this seems to be a big migration, in my opinion (and I could be wrong).

    AND, getting rid of that eyesore of a mall is awesome.. Anything built in that spot will be an improvement.

    We lived on the West Side of HP for roughly 10yrs now, I walk my dogs on the West side residential area a few times a month to see the the progress, and there's a lot of it. Some of those buildings were well overdue for a reno.

    Side note, i'm curious to see what is going on with the (2) 1/2 built homes on Kedzie Division.. They're taking a long time to finish. Exposed wood the these elements is probably not so good for the 'bones" of the home.

    AND, the "party garage" on Division got a roof...

    Of course there is going to be corruption. Where do you think you live? If you don't like it... I suggest you leave Chicago for some little suburb in Tennessee where things can move a little slower for you to understand. AND, there's mainly White people living there so you will feel very comfortable and may possibly leave your basement.

    Not sure if I agree or disagree. What's the big deal if this guy wants to build a large home on this lot? It's his lot, right? Change zoning? It happens all the time in Chicago. The little red house looks a little dilapidated. Sometimes homes are not built well in the first place and will not stand the test of time.. This means, knock it down a build a new. Chicago is an old City and new construction is going to happen.. If someone wants to build a big or small home, I say let'em. Who are we to say he/she cannot.. Because we don't like it? I don't like mint ice cream, so I stay away from it and I hope no one would have an opinion about it.

    Be thankful it's not going to some crappy developer that wants to build a cheap-azz house just to sell and make money. I would much rather have a nice home someone is going to live in, than some thrown up piece of garbage just for a sale. People are so afraid if change, I am tired of the "don't change my neighborhood" attitude. It happens, deal with it.

    Cyn, the PR fest is way behind on funds owed to the city. Maybe, just maybe, if the PR Fest gave back to the community (other than the fest itself), maybe HP would be viewed in a different light. As of now, HP looks like one giant leach with nothing else to grab on to. I think HP is tapped out as far as getting support from, well, anything that is not paid for by the city.. This is not a good sign. So, the only event HP has, is literally broke.. I would welcome (10) stages of blaring noise just to get HP out of it's financial funk. Have you seen how long it is taking for the PR Arts Museum (The Stables) to finish the roof?? Years.... Years.... Years.... At least (5). BUT, they certainly had money to buy Fake Horses, yah, money well spent..

    You had your chance at a great neighborhood. Ya'll blew it... You blew it to the point where property values hit a low and enabled folks to come in an swipe up some property at a great bargain. It's your own fault. You let HP become crime infested and scared people into believing this is the best they can do. Well, as most things do, it changed. It s changing for the better and you cannot stop it. The 606 and the beautiful park are key attractions to most people that like living in the city.

    Wait til they expand on the HP beach! It's so funny, because the same people that were fighting against RF to end Gentrification, are the same people fighting to keep the beach. Now, they're going to get a state of the art sustainable beach / swimming area.. This is going to be getting lots of attention throughout Chicago since this will be the FIRST public,self sustaining, swimming area in the Nation. You think RF brought the new folks? HP is about to blow up once they finish plans for this beach and there will be nothing you can do.

    The Chicago Park District is banking off Riot Fest, those permits are not cheap.
    You are correct, the "City" does not make the money, but the CPD definitely does... Why do you think it keeps getting moved from Park to Park? This is supplementing income the PD has lost throughout the year.

    Puerto Rican Fest: That is one fest that needs to go away for 1-3 years.. It needs to re-group and pay back some of the money it owes the city. It's beyond me how someone can shoot at someone in broad daylight and the city/Alderman/people act like nothing happened. This Fest needs to be cut off from Humboldt Park. Bring it back Downtown, leave the little communities out of this money sucking event.

    There are some very sick people in that hospital, mentally and physically. Seeing what that hospital is like first hand, I believe the city made a bad choice.

    I am still going to the 3-day event, and I am sure I will love it, but not without a little sympathy and guilt for sure.

Only someone this young will show this kind of immaturity. FGFM, I cannot wait til you grow the F-up. Anytime you would like to have a non-violent, non-yelling, open minded, sit down conversation... I will buy us dinner... You can pick the place.. But, please choose Humboldt Park since I am interested in supporting our local business. Not sure where you live, I know it isn't HP, but I guess you can drive your Ferrari or Porche, or whatever awesome car you drive (which I am sure is better than my Jeep).

Fortunately, no one is taking the land from you, no one is killing your people, no one is burning your property, no one is giving you a reservation to live on, and hopefully not threatening you in any way.

    There is no sense of entitlement here, but there is a sense of wanting to live in a nice area. Why not HP? Is there some sort of unwritten rule stating on cannot live here? I bought my home from someone who was selling it. I did not force them out of their home with a pitchfork and a torch. You need to grow up and stop acting like a martyr. This is life and reality. We all have our own set of problems to deal with, god knows, I don't want my neighbors/neighborhood to be another one.

    I'm from the Southside Chicago (born and raised), Nelly, this is an oasis from what I am used to. I can live wherever I choose, whether I am AA, PR, WH, AS, or whatever ethnicity I am. HP does not = PR.

    Let's be clear about something... Riot Fest was not in charge of "fixing" the park... There is no way CPD is going to let Riot Fest employees fix the park... The funds were given to CPD to fix the park by Riot Fest, I am sure they used the funds elsewhere and did a half-a$$ job of repairing. Therefore, Riot Fest looks like the bad guy.

    Also, Riot Fest did not want to be on the Northside of the park, this decision was made by Ald. and CPD, not Riot Fest. If it was held on the Southside, these problems would be non-existent. I thought everyone knew this? To me, this seems like public knowledge.

    Can't you all be a little happy HP is becoming a better place to live? 6-7 years ago, I remember telling gangbangers to get off my porch in my fenced in, single family home (they also used to unscrew the exterior light so they could hang..). Yes, they were cool, no issues... but, now I have no fear of this happening again. Great strides in the past 5-years, way to go HP! I do not contribute this to whitey moving in, but seems like a little coincidence. It could also be that my neighbors have no problem calling the cops and point out the offender at the drop of a dime.

    I think you all need to look around and see that HP is changing for the better. Sorry other people are moving into your hood, but as I said in the past, this is not a Reservation. Anyone can move anywhere they want. If you don't like it, maybe you should move. Or are you just mad because there are more PR's moving out of HP than moving in... This could be a "PR Flight" for no reason.. Maybe they see they are getting top dollar for their home and are taking advantage of it. There is nothing wrong with that..Maybe some are using the money for retirement? I know this is the case for one of my PR neighbors that sold their place.

    Chicago is a melting pot, deal with it. There are very, very few neighborhoods that stay the same in a 20YR time period, history shows this to be true. So please stop whining about your neighborhood changing... They neighborhood I grew up in changed... You don't see me crying a river.

    And also, let's be clear... Riot Fest is NOT causing Gentrification in HP.... It is the 606, the proximity to downtown, the beautiful park and nice homes with lots of potential. 3-Day Music Festivals do not cause population movements, BUT, it does bring a ton of money to the area for those few days.. Who would want to get rid of that?? Oh... HP Residents.. Sad.

Let me assure you most people have their hearts are in the right place. They want a safe and beautiful place to live. Please tell me how this is negatively affecting the community. By raising Taxes? Well, that is not my fault. My taxes go up too. I am not a well to do individual, although, I am working hard to achieve that every day. I want my taxes to stay low...

    This thread is mainly about Lopez. I heard, from his mouth directly, racist comments about white people on May 4th in front of the Ald's office. This guy is supposed to be someone the community looks up to? This is whom you want your kids to take advice from? The man that is trying to stop the White Barbarians from taking over HP? No one is taking over anything. People are selling in HP, and other people are buying.. Remember "White Flight"? Maybe there's a "PR Flight" happening right under our noses and we don't see it. Regardless, I haven't seen or heard of one person being pushed out of HP. People are selling their property, making top dollar, and moving on.

Another year or two, the local business would have figured out how to cater to that crowd and prepare for it every year and make money, money, money.

There is no way a 3-day concert event causes Gentrification. It's the 606. Now, with that being said, I semi-agree with you... I do not want a Starbucks... I do not want high-end shopping of any kind... I don't want to see the "Bros" (Lincoln Park White dudes). BUT.. You have the term Yuppie all wrong. Yuppie means "Wealthy / Trust Fund / Young". Not sure this is fitting the criteria of your argument. I know of NO yuppies in HP. So far, all seem to be middle class / lower class. Me, I am not a college grad... I am not wealthy....

    This is terrible. You all should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves for regressing back to your High School selves. Let me tell you all something... Go ahead and fight Riot Fest... This is going to open the door to eliminate all fest's in HP. Including the PR Fest. I personally don't want this. You all sound incredibly uneducated and this can all back fire with lasting effects on the community as a whole. Get a hold of your emotions and act like adults. Pathetic. Please note... The PR Fest does not have to pay for Permits for the HP.. This is something Ald. Maldonado had set up. At any time, CPD and tell the PR to F-Off since they don't pay a dime.. Be careful, it will be a whole lot easier to end the PR fest than it will RF. RF is a money making machine and pays CPD big bucks for permits and park improvements. That is more than any event I have seen in HP in 10YRS +. Be carful what you fight for, there can be serious repercussions. Money talks more than a small group of people that don't approve of a fest in their area. This is reality. Chicago is not broke, but we are not rich.. CPD needs all the help than get with funds generated from Chicago Fests. Where do you thing the money comes to maintain the Park system? Just taxes? No. CPD has to be a little creative in their ways to create liquid funds for themselves. This is why they do it. ------------------- Also, please stop the racist cr@p. Humboldt Park is not a "Reservation", it is open to all. No one owns the park, the only thing you own is that little piece of property you pay taxes on. The rest is public and up for grabs. This is reality. Deal with it. You all are being petty and stupid.

    "Go back to your suburbs" "We don't want you here" "You don't belong here" "We were here first" "We own the Park" "We refuse to share our park with you"

    I will spare you the vulgarity that went along with this.

    This is what I heard last Monday @ Ald. Maldonado's office. The Anti-Riot Fest folks were very vocal in their reason for not wanting Riot Fest... I didn't hear one thing about the condition of the park... It was all about the racial tension it's causing...

    Personally, I believe this is not about the park. The park is a pawn being used to stop the what they think is "Gentrification". Sadly, I feel this is purely a racial issue and they are in fear of HP changing.

    There is something very stupid about this whole situation.

    I dislike you very much Ald. Maldonado. You are a sneaky liar. So sad you won this election... I hate you will be in office another 4-years fighting imaginary battles brought up by a few of your brainless constituents.

    The housing market is pretty steady at the moment.. Agreed, its not at it's fullest. Hopefully it will never go back to Pre-2008. BUT, if you have good credit and a down payment, you can get your home.

    Allen, it is not a Pipe Dream for Gentrification. Not all people want HP to change. Personally, I am very happy with HP the way it is.. I don't want a Starbucks / High end clothing stores / ect. I like the little shops and family owned business.

    The only thing, it's happening whether you like it or not. The moment that word "Gentrification" is associated with HP, that's a bad sign for you. People from all over the nation will be looking at HP, not just people from surrounding areas. It's too late.

    You should hang out with Oscar Lopez. You guys seem to be preaching the same hate.

    Again, I will say, be angry at the people selling their homes for top dollar. Not the people moving in. You have this all wrong... If no one was selling their property, we wouldn't be in this situation.

Beware what you complain about. You're basically giving more fuel to the gentrification fire, which is nice and warm.. you can almost cook a hot dog. I like Hot Dogs. Maybe i'll open a Hot Dog Truck and call it "Space Dogs" and put it in the park. White people love Hot Dogs.

    Let's make this simple: Business's are responsible for the upkeep. The same goes for food trucks. Now put this food truck on City owned property. Said food truck is leaving waste and debris around it establishment. This truck is also using the City's garbage system for their disposal. I am not going to make assumptions about what they do with the grease, I will hope for the best on that one.

    Now, if you owned a restaurant on a property, you are required to have a Dumpster and a grease bin (for grease storage). That is a hefty monthly fee, BTW.

    So, am I to think my tax dollars are helping this person turn a profit on the city's dime? AND, you want me to clean up their mess? No way.

    I personally don't care what kind of food it is, that is not the issue. That particular truck has been leaving it's mess for years. If you haven't noticed, they have also set up chairs and tables to the area adjacent the truck. Not against it, but this is a main entrance to the park. It looks bad. I invite you to challenge me on that one. Go take a look yourself.

    I am not sure how any of you are defending this Food Truck. These people are turning a profit and polluting the area around them. It could not be more clear? I will pick up garbage for the non-responsible folks, I will not pick up after a for-profit business.

    This is why I write this post, not to just complain, but to raise awareness so we can come to a conclusion on how to make this work for all parties. Including the business owner.

    BTW, this has nothing to do with Riot Fest... Although, I do approve of the jokes.

    My PR neighbors do not mind the Gentrification. They are getting top dollar for their homes, selling, and moving on. When I say Top Dollar, I mean, initially, they were asking more than what the property was worth. I see it all over HP. Take a look at REFIN, folks selling property all over the place. Whether you like it or not, Allen, it;s happening. This is not a bad thing, It's not a good thing, but it's something you will have to deal with. Personally, I would rather deal with a neighborhood getting better than a neighborhood getting worse. Allen, no one is raping neighborhoods... These neighborhoods are offering themselves up to be gentrified. My neighbors that sold their property, those are the folks you should be angry at... Not the people buying. No one is forcing ANYONE out.

It goes against my morals of "weeding out the idiots in life". The moment I see a positive post, or you doing something good for someone, I may re-think my thoughts about you. Until then, I will battle you all day long.

    Define "GANG": an organized group of criminals.

    This is what you want the future around you to be? Do you think when your 65yrs old, and you get mugged and beaten by some young thug/gang members they're going to listen to your old stories of "how it used to be"? No, they're going to rob you, and possibly beat the tar out of you.

    I strongly suggest you look at your future and try to think what will suite you the best. If you don't like what HP is becoming, then leave. Go find an unsafe area so you can thrive. Do not threaten with posts up Gang Uprisings and the downfall of Gentrification. My ancestors were in HP way before you were even a twinkle in your momma's eye.

    Kate, non-racial discussions have to start somewhere, this is the only way we are ever going to get to the next level. It does not bother me that the Art's Center is centered around PR Culture. I would have had the same opinion if they were trying to build a German Arts Center, or a African American Arts Center. This discussion is about what is right for the area and will help people the most (being a non-profit). Not everything is about Race. I just don't think the Art's Center is a very good idea and do not see how it is really going to benefit the area. I hope I am wrong. I hope that area starts to boom because of this... But, when I sit back and think of all the bad deals and mis-management of money in Humboldt Park, it makes me very skeptical. Unfortunately I do not see our political folks having HP's best interest in mind, I feel it benefits a couple people greatly and becomes a burden to the rest. Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with race.

    Since that was my statement, I will reply. I agree, most NFP's do pay their employees, ECT.. I am referring this particular venture, The New Arts Center. I am very sure this is not going to turn a profit. I believe it to be a bad idea and a financial drain. How many people will it hire full time?? 3, maybe 4? The rest will be volunteer or part time. Maybe all will be part time and they will not have to pay benefits. I am very familiar this sort of business, I will bet dollars to donuts, there will only be maybe 1-2 people that will get a decent salary and or benefits, the rest will be part time at a low pay or Volunteer workers.

    I respect your post and agree with the statistics. I am just very skeptical about an "Arts Center" for non-profit. I think they are blowing good real estate on a bad idea. Like I said earlier, I hope I eat my own words. I want nothing but the best for HP and to keep it's Cultural Diversity. I just don't agree with this particular idea. They can do better.

I've been in the Arts for 25yrs, it seldom pays off to earn a living. If it does, you're one of the lucky ones. I also drive by an Arts Center everyday... We need another one?

Why did they buy life size plastic horses instead? This is why I have my doubts about Humboldt Park's "best interest". New Roof or Plastic Horses? They chose poorly. They should have bought a couple of jackasses instead.

    Thankfully you guys know and understand the term "Gentrification". Not everyone shares your intelligence. The term definitely has been used to portray the movement of white people to a lower income area. Property taxes are raised, blah blah blah. I know this first hand having open conversations with neighbors and being born with common sense. What we don't need, is someone giving the hint of negative reinforcement to this term. That is what Maldonado is doing and has done in the past. That is sort of what he insinuated in that article, hence, this is why we are @ 50 comments on this thread. So, screw that guy, he should just stick to his shady Real Estate investments and let HP strive with business and community development.

    While we're on the subject, Division IS a dump. It could be better... why isn't it? There are some beautiful flags at each end, with a bunch of cr*p in the middle. So instead of creating a business plan to hype up the area (bringing jobs with benefits / 401K Ect) Let's open a Non-For-Profit where I am sure most people will not be getting paid... Or receiving benefits..Or a 401K. How is this helping the community as a whole? It definitely won't be putting money in their pockets. Thanks for another non-profit business that will bleed money from the community. It's great you can go see a show and drink some wine, but will they be paying taxes on that property? Probably not. If they do, it will be minimal. So, it won't really be helping the city, financially. I have an idea... Tax Breaks and Construction Tifs for business that actually want to open and pay people?? Doesn't that sound like a good plan? Those businesses will pay taxes. I don't understand why no one can see the reality of this. More money in an area, means better EVERYTHING. Better streets, better sidewalks, better street/sidewalk lighting, ect. I like REALMCCOYS list. It puts lots of things into perspective.

    No, no one said the Theater was a bad idea... It was Maldonado's wording of "Gentrification" that krinkled everyone's undies..

    He needs to accept the fact that Chicago Neighborhoods are constantly changing. It's been happening forever and nothing will stop it. A good politician would be accepting of all people moving into his or her Ward and take advantage of the change. He is not a good Alderman and his best interests do not appeal to general sense of community. The Puerto Rican element will never be out of HP, and that is awesome, but stop making this a racial competition. No one is pushing anyone out of their homes or not making them feel welcome. If anything, me being German/Irish, it has been difficult to be accepted by some of my neighbors because I am part of the "gentrification movement", which in my eyes means, "Whitey's moving in". People, let the change happen and lets all work together to build a great community.

    Hey Neal, thanks for the info. I was good till your last statement.

    "Really, if you don't want your dog to bark outside, don't leave it out alone. Walk it. Let it do it's business, PICK UP THE BUSINESS, take your dog back in."

    I bought a single family home (fenced in) because I am a dog lover and this is what I chose. I have also installed a dog door which we have had for the past 6yrs, so the dogs can go in and out as they wish. We walk the dogs everyday in HP and we do PICK UP THE BUSINESS. We also PICK UP THE BUSINESS everyday in the yard if need be. Thanks for the info, but, my dogs were here before the cats, this is why I posted on EB before I took any action. I am currently training my dogs not to bark at the cats.

    I'm on Spaulding just South of Division. These little bastards are driving my dogs crazy... One was in the yard this morning and was almost caught by my (2) dogs. I feel the outcome would have been bad since this is one of the same cats that has been tormenting my dogs though the fence. I do like cats, this is not cat bashing..

    I heard TNR requires you to somewhat take care of the cats for a period of time? Is this true?

    Find out who the General contractor is from one of the workers, call their main office. Tell them you will call the police if the crew does not start at the permitted time (MIKE Q is correct, you need to find out the permitted time). If they do not comply, call the office one more time. If they do not comply again, call the police and explain your case. The General Contractor can get fined from the city for not following permit guidelines.

    If you want to really cover this correctly. Take some video/audio with your mobile device showing the time and hearing/see the construction. Just so you have some proof if you ever need it.

    Good luck!

    This Fest needs to be shut down for a year or two. Too much violence, period. They need to bring this back to a family/cultural event. It's a joke.

    Southside Irish Parade: Shut down for way less than this. City Hall was obviously doing their job when they shut it down for three years, the Parade is now a wholesome family event. Please note, they mainly shut it down for public intoxication, not violence. This is a fact.

    Someone is not doing their job if they think the PR Fest of doing fine. Sounds like someone is more interested in votes other than public safety.

    Humboldt Park and it's patrons flat out embarrass themselves every year. No one should be in fear to leave their home or plan a vacation because of an event happening in their neighborhood.

    This needs to stop. This event scars this area every year. It brings down property values and promotes violence the rest of the year. "Why shouldn't violence be ok, it's Humboldt Park".

    I, for one, have had enough of the stigma this Fest brings. Our Politicians need to open their eyes and start doing their job by removing the stigma of violence. They need to do it now.

    @RogerParker: I am not new to the neighborhood. Every year I am being told this event is supposed to be getting better and better. Well, it's not. Especially Saturday night when some unloaded a clip at the end if my block. Do you think anyone should be used to that?? I don't accept violence, Roger. Maybe you do, and that's part of the problem.

    Hey Gale, I didn't hear one gunshot during Riot Fest, nor did I see one person throwing up gang signs. There was a gang war at the end of my block on Sat. night where at least (20) shells were found in front of a neighbors house. We actually played a game, "Gunshot or Firework".

    These (2) events are not comparable. Riot Fest is a private event where patrons have to pay lots of money to enter and is completely fenced in. PR Fest is Free and open to the public. Not the same event. Also, Riot Fest pays for ALL damages and repairs to Humboldt Park. This is a true statement. HP makes lots of cash from that event. The Red Eye article does not state who is paying for the damages, it is not the CPD. It's Riot Fest. Get your facts straight.

    The PR Fest bleeds money from the city for this event. Did you see all the law enforcement?? Did you see the (3) Helicopters?? Do you know how much money this costs?

    I agree, it's getting better. BUT... Why would Chicago fund an event that has violence tied to it EVERY year? Think of the tax dollars being used for law enforcement every year. Since they know there are going to be people out of control, they beef up enforcement. This costs money, and lots of it. Why? Just so they can keep the violence at a minimum? Why even allow the event to happen knowing people are going to be hurt or killed? They also know Gangs are going to be an issue. This make absolutely no sense to me. Open up your eyes Chicago!!! You are surely lacking common sense.

    The Southside Irish Parades were shut down for way less than this. SHUT THIS EVENT DOWN. At least for a year or two. Every year there is violence. EVERY YEAR! Who the hell thinks this is acceptable??? Our Alderman?? This is exactly why Humboldt Park has a bad rap. They accept violence.

    This is common sense people !!

    Does anyone here want to be hit by a stray bullet?? There were plenty last night. It could have happened.

    Why should the innocent folk have to deal with this?? Please, someone give me a good answer and I will shut-up.

    The significant other spoke to the neighbor over the phone one morning after we saw the tube moved back toward our yard.. It became heated for a moment. Then, the neighbor went online and did finally realize what they are doing was illegal. Now, the tube is moved far from our yard and the issue seems to be handled.
    I wish it did not get to a heated point, but the neighbor truly thought it was our problem and not theirs.
    Hopefully we are still on good terms, but we have not seen them to find out if this is the case.

    I think it would be great to have more of a positive mural of PR Culture. I've seen this before, and it is a disturbing mural. I like the fact there is history involved, but I see no history of this event having anything to do with Chicago.
    Even if it is the oldest PR Mural in Chicago, it still depicts violent acts.
