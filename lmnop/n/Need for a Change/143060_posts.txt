"Know Your Rights" Workshop

    There is nothing worse than disingenuous narcissist cop haters who only care about getting themselves reelected by catering to the dysfunctional masses. Long Live Mumia, Pelletier, and Fred Hampton in the 49th Ward.This area needs new leadership. VOTE TRUMP for a better AMERICA!!!!

Some-ting Wong if DeJuaun Pratt gets a life sentence but Eric Vaughn is only facing 12 years

    DeJaun Pratt deserves to rot away in prison for the rest of his life, but so does violent recidivist offender Eric Vaughn. Is our Cook County States Attorney and Criminal Justice system that pathetic that Vaughn can get away with a prison sentence of 12 years maximum?

Why do we have Chronic Violent Crime of this Nature? Because we tolerate it!!!!! Part 2

    When individuals who commit violent acts such as that which occurred on Clark Street last Sunday night they should be punished as the law provides rather than being spoon fed as the dynamics which are decaying our society is allowing far too often. To look up someone like Eric Vaughn, ...

Why do we have Chronic Violent Crime of this Nature? Because we tolerate it!!!!! Part 1

    If the role players in our criminal justice system, including public officials on nearly all levels, were responsible to the community in performing the tacit obligations of their offices we would be convicting ANYONE caught illegally in possession of or illegally utilizing a firearm. Unfortunately, far too many of these ...

Make America's Economy Strong Again, Say No To Immigration Reform

    Cutting our social overgrown safety net which under the social worker mentality of the Obama administration has fostered a chronic welfare class despite Barry's 2007-08 campaign promises is a major facet needed to resolve the USA's economic struggles. Getting those capable of working and contributing to the community by being ...

Do Not Vote for Kim Foxx!!

"Mandatory Minimum Sentencing"

Gallagher's Tavern 1770 W Greenleaf Liquor License Revoled, but back in business

Aldermen Moore and Osterman to Host Workshop on Hoarding

NYPD POLICE MURDERED EXECUTION STYLE AS "REVENGE" for individuals who died resisting arrest

FRIDAY SEPT 5: ANOTHER Rogers Park Shooting
