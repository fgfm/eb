 Need for a Change 20 years in Rogers Park

 Without reference to any comments posted here or any public officials, I just want to state that I am totally sick of urban violence which is perpetuated by young thugs who are often associated with street gangs grounded in organized criminal activity. While gangs may have the right to assemble as "social groups" as defined by the US Supreme Court they certainly do not have the right to organize themselves in criminal activity or enterprise. What is most distressong is that our criminal justice system and communities are impotent to their presence and negative effects upon our community. I hope that I am able to reach retirement age and escape from this area before I too become a victim of an irrational problem.
